# SourceHunt optimization campaign

This campaign optimizes Clearwing for small local models while keeping every
candidate prompt solution-independent. The original task model was
`dsv4-flash-nvfp4` at:

```text
http://tinybox.taile6728b.ts.net:30000/v1
```

The vLLM server must enable native tools, for example with
`--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser deepseek_v3`. Both automatic and
required tool selection have been verified against this endpoint.

The ranks 781–804 continuation used the same frozen treatment with
`DeepSeek-v4-Flash-0731` through a replacement OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
Endpoint credentials are runtime configuration and are not committed.

## Experiment variables

Prompt, scaffold, and context policy are independent variables:

- `legacy-v1`: existing behavior, retained for compatibility.
- `generic-security-v1`: generic discovery loop with solution heuristics and
  historical CVE context disabled.
- `native-v1`: the existing Clearwing tool surface.
- `minimal-linear-v1`: Read/Grep/Trace/Submit only.
- `candidate-ledger-v1`: minimal tools plus typed, persistent hypothesis state.
- `candidate-ledger-closure-v1`: the candidate ledger unchanged until the final
  three model calls, when a short generic countdown forces submit/reject/finish
  closure on the strongest candidate.
- `candidate-ledger-source-retry-v1`: candidate ledger plus one runtime repair
  turn when the first response invokes no source tool. A second text-only
  response stops as `no_source_action`; the retry is absent from the standing
  prompt.
- `candidate-ledger-source-retry-active-v1`: source retry plus a generic
  submission invariant: `record_finding` must cite a pending, investigating, or
  validated ledger candidate. This blocks findings after every hypothesis was
  rejected without requiring the stronger proof scaffold.
- `window-ledger-v1`: candidate ledger plus generic static source-window ranking.
- `guided-window-ledger-v1`: opaque ranked-window reads with mandatory initial
  coverage, removing line-plan translation from the model.
- `state-interaction-ledger-v1`: expands the strongest read anchor into a compact,
  target-blind packet of declarations, initialization, writes, comparisons, and
  one-hop state producers before candidate commitment.
- `proof-refinement-ledger-v1`: keeps the state-interaction packet unchanged and
  exposes one bounded, obligation-specific source packet only after a failed
  structured domain proof.
- `legacy-context-v1`: existing growing transcript, retained as a control.
- `compact-small-model-v1`: shorter static instructions/tool schemas, 3.5k-char
  tool-result clipping, and deterministic compaction near 12k estimated request
  tokens. It keeps a small complete assistant/tool tail plus durable active and
  rejected candidates, counterevidence, next checks, and trace evidence. Raw
  source windows remain disposable because they can be reread.

Select them with `--prompt-bundle`, `--scaffold-profile`, and
`--context-profile`. Ablation IDs and baseline groups include all three values,
so results from different treatments cannot be mixed accidentally.

## Leakage boundary

Optimization candidates are rejected if they contain benchmark CVEs, commits,
target files, distinctive symbols, expected CWEs, known mechanism labels, or
ground-truth phrases. Reflection traces are redacted by the same manifest-derived
policy before reaching the reflection model.

The generic bundle also disables the legacy FFmpeg-specific memory-safety hints
and CVE seed context. Do not use `--seed-cves`, case-specific campaign hints, or
the specialist prompt when collecting optimization data.

## LAIR offline supervision

LAIR's `training/cve_data_extraction` goldens are useful outside the hunter
boundary. They contain source-verified `discovery -> investigation -> challenge`
chains, but they also contain answer-bearing commits, changed files, citations,
symbols, root-cause prose, and fix behavior. Never attach a LAIR task, golden, or
retrieved excerpt to a blind hunter request.

`clearwing.eval.sourcehunt_lair` validates the upstream `GoldenChain` contract and
converts each causal trace into abstract next-action rows. A row contains only:

- completed trace kinds and completed generic proof obligations;
- the next generic proof obligation;
- one bounded context category to request next.

It never copies a CVE, repository, commit, path, symbol, citation, claim, CWE,
fix fact, vulnerability description, case key, or repository key. Before output, a leakage audit compares
every emitted string with case identifiers, paths, source excerpts, and
source-level identifiers. Splits are deterministic by repository, so two CVEs
from the same codebase cannot cross train/development/test. `ffmpeg` is reserved
and excluded by default even if a future corpus contains it.

After LAIR has generated and audited its collected `goldens/CVE-*.json` files,
build SourceHunt routing supervision with:

```bash
uv run python evaluations/build_sourcehunt_lair_dataset.py \
  --goldens /data/lair-cve-training-data \
  --output-dir /data/sourcehunt-lair-router-v1
```

The output contains `router/{train,development,test}.jsonl` and `manifest.json`.
The manifest records corpus and split digests without retaining reversible case
metadata. Treat the development fold as permanently opened once it participates
in scaffold or prompt selection. Keep the test fold sealed until the router and
validator policies are frozen.

The first intended consumer is a small deterministic or learned router choosing
the next on-demand context category. It is not a source-text generator and must
not lengthen the standing hunter prompt. A second consumer can score validator
decisions against LAIR challenge outcomes and exact citations, but this must run
offline; only the blind finding and source-derived trace enter production
validation.

### Differential validator replay

`evaluations/run_sourcehunt_lair_validator.py` measures the existing validator
on LAIR goldens without exposing a snapshot label. It builds one alleged finding
from the vulnerable golden, selects bounded source windows from that trace, and
submits the identical finding twice. Only the source text at the pinned revision
changes. A correct pair advances the vulnerable snapshot and rejects the fixed
snapshot.

```bash
uv run python evaluations/run_sourcehunt_lair_validator.py \
  --campaign-root /data/lair-cve-training-data \
  --base-url http://tinybox.taile6728b.ts.net:30000/v1 \
  --model dsv4-flash-nvfp4 \
  --prompt-profile legacy-v1 \
  --temperature 0 \
  --max-output-tokens 16384 \
  --output results/sourcehunt-optimization/lair-validator-pilot.json
```

The replay reports vulnerable recall, fixed rejection rate, pair accuracy,
per-axis pass counts, model errors, false negatives, and fixed false positives.
Use the same completed golden set for every validator treatment. Do not optimize
on the replay test fold or use fix citations to choose the source windows.

The replay uses `balanced-anchor-v1` context. It derives all paths, coordinates,
and anchors from the vulnerable trace, allocates the character budget fairly
across causal paths, and selects fixed-width line slots nearest those anchors.
Both revisions therefore receive exactly the same line coordinates; only source
text changes. This prevents early alphabetical paths from consuming the context
budget and hiding the authoritative operation or guard in a later path.

Always set an explicit output cap for small reasoning models. An uncapped pilot
request generated roughly 568,000 tokens without reaching the constrained JSON.
The replay now defaults to 8,192 output tokens, retries invalid output once under
the same cap, records the cap and temperature in its v2 result, and never scores
a model-error rejection as a correct fixed negative.

### LAIR development pilot (2026-08-12)

The opened pilot contains 12 completed source-verified C/C++ chains from 12
repositories. The leakage-safe routing adapter emitted 107 development rows:

- trace targets: 12 attack sources, 12 entry points, 20 propagations, 13 state
  transitions, 14 guard failures, 12 vulnerable operations, 12 security effects,
  and 12 challenge actions;
- context targets: 24 input/caller, 20 dataflow, 13 state/representation, 14
  guard/control-flow, 24 operation/effect, and 12 counterevidence requests;
- serialized vocabulary: 22 fixed ontology strings, with no CVE, repository,
  commit, path, symbol, excerpt, vulnerability prose, or FFmpeg text.

The original legacy diagnostic, before balanced selection and explicit sampling,
scored 83.3% vulnerable recall, 75.0% fixed rejection, and 58.3% pair accuracy
with no model errors. Its three fixed false positives all omitted a decisive late
path from the capped context, so it is useful failure evidence but not the final
controlled baseline.

The controlled temperature-zero comparison used identical `balanced-anchor-v1`
context and a 16,384-token cap:

| Validator prompt | Vulnerable recall | Fixed rejection | Pair accuracy | Errors |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `legacy-v1` | 91.7% | 58.3% | 50.0% | 0 |
| `source-first-compact-v2` | 91.7% | 58.3% | 58.3% | 0 |

The compact prompt aligned one additional pair, but 1/12 on an opened development
fold is not enough to promote it. Keep `legacy-v1` as the production default and
treat `source-first-compact-v2` as the leading optimization candidate. A longer
`source-first-high-recall-v1` ablation overcorrected: at an 8,192-token cap it
scored 33.3% vulnerable recall, 91.7% fixed rejection, 25.0% pair accuracy, and
two model errors. Do not promote it.

Five temperature-zero replicates per arm then showed that the one-pass advantage
was not promotion evidence:

| Validator prompt | Vulnerable recall | Fixed rejection | Pair accuracy | Errors |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `legacy-v1` | 86.7% (52/60) | 58.3% (35/60) | 46.7% (28/60) | 0/120 |
| `source-first-compact-v2` | 88.3% (53/60) | 56.7% (34/60) | 51.7% (31/60) | 1/120 |

The compact arm gained three paired decisions but regressed fixed rejection and
produced one capped structured-output failure. Wilson 95% intervals overlap
broadly. The aggregate, exact input digests, opaque per-case stability, and seed
provenance are recorded in
`results/sourcehunt-optimization/lair-validator-replicates/summary.json` (SHA256
`efbbbd14a936192e1b546844aef48d0f19a0699b5151c43dc6e7abf0917e5468`).

The replication runner alternates arm order, checkpoints each complete arm,
resumes without repeating finished work, fails on configuration/case/coordinate
drift, and uses pooled Wilson intervals. Promotion requires all of the following:

- vulnerable recall at least the replicated legacy control;
- fixed rejection at least the replicated legacy control;
- mean pair accuracy above the control with stable per-case behavior;
- zero model errors at the 16,384-token cap.

### Leakage-safe validator GEPA result

Core GEPA ran directly over a deterministic 6/6 split of the same opened 12-case
development fold. Each case scored 35% vulnerable correctness, 35% fixed
correctness, and a 30% same-case bonus; any model error scored zero. GEPA saw only
opaque case handles. Reflection saw only a generic natural-language lesson—never
golden prose, source, identifiers, coordinates, axes, metric keys, or arm labels.
Candidates were limited to 2,000 characters and rejected if they contained any
answer-bearing term or evaluation-protocol wording.

This boundary caught two optimizer shortcuts before promotion: one candidate
mentioned paired snapshots, and another copied an internal metric-field name.
Those diagnostic runs are preserved under explicitly rejected result directories.
The hardened run used 48 of a hard 60-call budget, evaluated four candidates, and
kept the 725-character `source-first-compact-v2` seed as best. Its stochastic seed
score was 0.892; every accepted mutation scored 0.783 on the six-case validation
half. Result: no GEPA mutation advances to replicated replay, and `legacy-v1`
remains the production default. Do not reopen FFmpeg or consume a sealed test fold
for this validator treatment.

## Evaluation design

Never optimize on positives alone. Use `include_fixed_negative_cases()` to add
every pinned patched snapshot as a negative control. The current manifest yields
an FFmpeg vulnerable/fixed pair; add more fixed pairs and clean repositories before
trusting transfer results.

Legacy scoring requires all of the following:

- correct target file and CWE;
- evidence stronger than suspicion;
- a multi-step trace linked to the target;
- at least two mechanism-bearing target symbols;
- a non-empty root-cause description.

File+CWE-only reports are false positives.

## GEPA

Install the optional integration:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --extra optimization
```

`clearwing.eval.sourcehunt_gepa.SourceHuntGEPAAdapter` runs the unchanged
SourceHunt system, scores each observation, and returns redacted actionable side
information. Core GEPA is used directly; SourceHunt is not rewritten as DSPy
ReAct, which keeps the runtime/sandbox constant during prompt experiments.

Use `optimize_sourcehunt_prompt()` with train/validation
`SourceHuntOptimizationExample` lists. The adapter fails closed unless the
manifest contains both confirmed positives and disproven fixed/clean controls.
For a no-charge local endpoint, set both token-price fields to `0.0`; action,
model-call, and scaffold limits still bound execution independently of cost.
These run-scoped prices propagate through the spend ledger, HunterPool, and
each native hunter. This is required: otherwise the global fallback price for
an unknown model can prematurely stop file dispatch even while the authoritative
local-endpoint ledger correctly records zero dollars.
Set `max_hunt_files` to cap repository-wide fan-out after generic ranking; the
selection uses priority descending with a stable path tie-break.
Use `max_hunter_steps`, `max_parallel`, `starting_band`, and
`redundancy_override` to hold per-file work constant across scaffold arms.
Use standard depth for scaffold optimization: it retains deep sandboxed hunters
but excludes the separate deep-depth harness generator from the comparison.
For small models, use bounded ranker chunks (currently 25 files, one chunk in
flight, one retry) so structured rankings fit comfortably in one response.
DeepSeek V4 Flash still returned truncated/empty ranker JSON at that size, so
the scaffold comparison disables LLM reranking and holds Clearwing's generic
deterministic static ranking constant across every arm.
The deterministic ranker scans production C/C++/Rust source with the same
repository-independent signal categories exposed by `rank_source_windows`.
Category counts saturate, signal diversity is rewarded, and only eight strong
line-local anchors contribute; this prevents large files or repeated memory
operations from monopolizing a bounded campaign. Test, documentation, example,
benchmark, and fuzz paths are excluded generically. The score and per-category
counts are retained on each file target for auditability.
Examples also fail closed unless they use blind repository-level ablations with
no assisted hint packet; target-file and later ablations are diagnostics only.
The current prompt/scaffold seam belongs to the legacy hunter, so GEPA examples
also reject the proof flow instead of silently scoring a prompt it does not use.
The reflection model may be a GEPA/LiteLLM model or `ClearwingReflectionLM` around
an existing native Clearwing client.

Optimization order:

1. Compare scaffolds with the fixed seed prompt.
2. Freeze the winning scaffold and optimize discovery instructions.
3. Freeze discovery and optimize investigation/challenge instructions.
4. Re-evaluate all candidates on held-out projects and fixed controls.
5. Run the winning generic configuration blindly across FFmpeg, then independently
   validate and deduplicate every finding.

## Local DeepSeek diagnostics (2026-08-11)

The endpoint emitted valid native tools through both raw OpenAI-compatible calls
and Clearwing's `AsyncLLMClient`. On the small heap-overflow fixture:

| Scaffold | Tokens | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| `minimal-linear-v1` | 13,420 | Correct overflow, suspicion evidence |
| `native-v1` | 20,926 | Correct overflow, suspicion evidence |

On the pinned vulnerable FFmpeg target-file ablation, 12-14-step static runs did
not find the labeled issue. Linear mode swept source windows; the enforced ledger
created explicit hypotheses but selected other mechanisms. This is a diagnostic
failure, not a prompt hint: retain it as negative optimization feedback.

Full proof-flow evaluation is not available on a host without Docker and Bear.
Do not treat static target-file diagnostics as the final FFmpeg campaign baseline.

Docker and Bear are now available through the local Colima Docker socket. The
pinned vulnerable and fixed FFmpeg checkouts each have a 2,174-entry compile
database, so repository-level proof-flow baselines are the authoritative results
below.

### Compact repository baselines

Both treatments used the same blind 24-file target set, 40 steps per hunter,
parallelism 4, standard depth, fast band, redundancy 1, deterministic static file
ranking, and zero local token prices.

| Scaffold | Vulnerable | Fixed | Vuln input | Fixed input | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `window-ledger-v1` | 0.175 | 1.0 | 9,039,148 | 8,359,653 | no findings |
| `guided-window-ledger-v1` | 0.175 | 1.0 | 9,310,919 | 9,440,150 | no findings |

Both vulnerable arms failed first at `true_candidate_generated`; both fixed arms
remained free of false reports. Guided ranked reads correctly forced W1/W2/W3 and
reduced the vulnerable target file from 389,660 to 358,643 input tokens, but the
model still isolated familiar memory operations, rejected two sound bounds
hypotheses, then repeated the first one. Navigation improved; semantic state
interaction did not.

The next scaffold therefore keeps the prompt short and moves generic context
assembly into a deterministic tool. For each anchor it extracts the dominant
mutable state and a compact role-labeled packet: representation, reserved-state
initialization, writers, comparisons, the stored producer, and that producer's
upstream state and guards. It derives every line from the current checkout and
uses no case manifest, patch, CVE, known filename, symbol, value, or mechanism.
On the pinned pair, the same generic algorithm includes the relevant state chain
in the vulnerable packet and independently includes the terminating producer
guard only in the fixed packet. No patch or answer-derived term participates in
packet construction.

### Proof-gated state interaction result

The state-interaction treatment initially found the right value-domain candidate
but spent its remaining turns rereading source and rewriting the candidate. A
generic checkpoint now activates after two source actions for a tracked,
unresolved domain. It blocks further source reads and candidate rewrites until
the hunter calls `record_domain_proof` with four explicit obligations:

1. attacker input reaches the producer;
2. the producer can reach the distinguished stored value;
3. the changed consumer branch reaches the extracted effect; and
4. the boundary effect lacks a dominating guard.

A false answer narrows the candidate's next check to the unresolved obligation.
Four true answers validate the candidate, record
`security_effect_possible`, seed exact source/transfer/condition/effect trace
steps, and permit a `static_corroboration` report. This small amount of enforced
control flow eliminated the model's executive loop without lengthening the
standing prompt.

The 40-step target-pair diagnostic at
`domain-proof-gated-40-diagnostics/summary.json` separated the snapshots:

- vulnerable: one validated finding with a four-step exact source trace;
- fixed: zero findings, with the extracted terminating guard correctly proving
  the producer and distinguished domains disjoint.

The blind repository run at
`domain-proof-gated-v1/state-interaction-ledger-v1--compact-small-model-v1.json`
used the same 24-file target set on each snapshot. It submitted exactly one
finding on the vulnerable target and none across the fixed files. Vulnerable and
fixed input totals were 8,546,607 and 8,468,558 tokens respectively. The recorded
scores were 0.125 and 1.0 because independent validation suppressed the positive,
not because discovery missed it.

The original validator call returned an empty response, so structured parsing
rejected the report. Validation now retries invalid or empty structured output
once with a short generic instruction, 8,192 output tokens, and the hunter's
exact vulnerability trace. A manual retry produced structured output but still
rejected the candidate on an incorrect practical-reachability claim. Treat that
as a validator false negative: the discovery and fixed-side differential remain
the useful scaffold signal, while validator reachability reasoning needs its own
bounded refinement.

### Context expansion ablation

Two subsequent target-pair ablations front-loaded additional, correctly
source-derived context about repeated-input reachability, dispatch, allocation
extent, and boundary addressing. Both regressed vulnerable discovery from one
finding to zero:

- `reachability-proof-gated-40-diagnostics`;
- `reachability-allocation-proof-40-diagnostics`.

The failure is important: correct context is not automatically useful context
for this model. Keep the winning initial packet compact. The next experiment
now exposes `read_domain_proof_refinement` only after a particular domain-proof
obligation remains false. Its schema is absent from earlier model requests, it
accepts only a recorded unresolved obligation, returns a bounded source-derived
packet for that obligation, and can be called only once before another structured
proof is required. The initial state-interaction packet is unchanged. Measure
this on-demand treatment against the same vulnerable/fixed controls before
beginning GEPA prompt search.

The first 40-step paired run of this treatment,
`on-demand-refinement-40-diagnostics`, produced zero findings on both snapshots.
The vulnerable hunter used three refinements but processed independent false
obligations in an inefficient order and temporarily treated a non-terminating
comparison as a producer cap. It corrected that interpretation only on its final
turn. The refinement loop now exposes one prerequisite at a time and labels
comparison context as terminating or non-terminating based on nearby control-flow
effects. This revision requires another paired diagnostic; do not promote it to a
repository run on the first result.

The revised run, `on-demand-refinement-ordered-40-diagnostics`, restored clean
separation. The vulnerable hunter submitted one validated finding after 23 model
calls and 230,190 input tokens; its seeded source/state-sink/condition/effect-sink
trace matched the compact winning run. The fixed hunter submitted zero findings
after 40 calls and 398,625 input tokens, correctly treating the extracted
terminating producer guard as proof that the domains are disjoint. Peak estimated
contexts were 11,389 and 11,621 tokens. This passes the target-pair promotion gate;
the next meaningful test was a blind repository run, not another target-file
replicate.

That blind 24-file run completed at
`proof-refinement-ledger-v1/proof-refinement-ledger-v1--compact-small-model-v1.json`.
It retained one vulnerable finding, zero fixed findings, and the same `[0.125,
1.0]` scores as the unchanged `state-interaction-ledger-v1` control. Independent
validation again suppressed the vulnerable positive, so correctness did not
improve. The refinement treatment used 8,425,157 vulnerable and 8,123,672 fixed
input tokens with 890 and 864 model calls. Relative to control, that is 121,450
and 344,886 fewer input tokens (about 1.4% and 4.1%) and 37 and 36 fewer calls.
Keep it as an efficiency candidate, not a promoted correctness winner. Do not
begin GEPA prompt search on this result; use the LAIR development fold to improve
generic routing and validator evaluation first.

## Blind FFmpeg discovery campaign (2026-08-13)

DeepSeek V4 Flash has meaningfully examined all 180 attempted deterministic
FFmpeg rank slots. Ranks 1–24 came from the earlier
repository baseline. Ranks 25–96 used the proof-refinement scaffold: 72 files,
24,751,510 tokens, 563 raw candidate updates, and no submitted findings. Ranks
97–108 were then
replayed as a controlled scaffold comparison using the same 12 files, 24 steps,
temperature 0, and a 4,096-token output cap:

| Scaffold | Tokens | Candidate calls | Step-cap hunters | Findings |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `minimal-linear-v1` | 2,345,124 | 0 | 9/12 | 0 |
| `candidate-ledger-v1` | 2,455,745 | 74 | 10/12 | 0 |
| `proof-refinement-ledger-v1` | 2,577,673 | 64 | 12/12 | 0 |

Use `candidate-ledger-v1` as the discovery baseline. Its 4.7% token overhead
over minimal-linear retains a reviewable hypothesis funnel. Proof refinement
cost 5.0% more than candidate ledger without improving submission yield. These
results do not establish a correctness winner because every arm submitted zero
findings. The exact inputs, campaign hashes, token components, call counts, and
decision are recorded in
`results/sourcehunt-optimization/ffmpeg-blind-campaign/matched-scaffold-ranks-0097-0108.json`.

Most hunters reached the hard step cap, so end-of-budget behavior is now an
independent scaffold variable. `candidate-ledger-closure-v1` preserves the
candidate-ledger standing prompt and tools, then supplies a generic remaining-call
count only for the final three calls. It tells the hunter to resolve, submit, or
reject its strongest candidate and forbids new broad exploration. Keep this as a
separate treatment so prior `candidate-ledger-v1` artifacts remain reproducible;
promote it only after a matched replay.

The matched closure replay did not pass that promotion gate. It used 2,306,771
tokens (6.1% fewer than candidate ledger) and retained 76 candidate calls, but
still submitted zero findings and left 10/12 hunters at the step cap. In the
final three steps the hunters made 28 source actions and 11 candidate updates,
but no trace or finding calls. The small model did not reliably obey the textual
closure request. Retain `candidate-ledger-v1` for unseen coverage; if closure is
revisited, make it a bounded runtime phase rather than adding more standing
prompt text.

Offline source tracing independently supports two deduplicated root causes:

- H.264 slice ownership stores an unbounded slice counter in a 16-bit table where
  slice 65,535 aliases the unavailable-entry sentinel. The fixed control adds the
  missing counter cap, and the production validator advanced the vulnerable report
  at high severity.
- Vulkan HEVC RPS construction may write more than the public Khronos array
  capacity of eight because the write loop uses FFmpeg's larger `nb_refs` without
  a destination-capacity guard. The production validator advanced the report at
  medium severity; no executable Vulkan trigger has yet established more than
  eight live current references.

At that checkpoint, neither issue had a crash-confirmed reproducer. Survivor details remain offline in
`evaluations/sourcehunt_ffmpeg_survivors.json`; never include that file or its
derived hypotheses in hunter context.

### Blind continuation and first crash-confirmed discovery

Candidate-ledger continuation attempted ranks 109–180. Source-action audit—not
the runner's historical `files_hunted` counter—confirms that all 24 files at
ranks 109–132, 19/24 at ranks 133–156, and 9/24 at ranks 157–180 actually ran a
source-bearing tool. Together with ranks 1–108, that is 160 meaningfully examined
files and 20 false completion slots. The failures were DeepSeek responses that
printed DSML/XML-like calls as ordinary text; the provider returned no native
tool call, and the old loop treated that as a clean finish. The unusually cheap
last waves are therefore parser/tool-call failures, not efficiency gains.

The missed ranks were 138, 146, 153, 154, 156, 158, 161, 162, 164, 167–169,
172, and 174–180. `candidate-ledger-source-retry-v1` repairs this generically at
runtime. A first sparse-offset replay exposed deterministic-ranker drift: current
offsets no longer resolved to all historical files after ranking code changed.
The final replay therefore used a sealed exact-path manifest and failed closed
if any requested file was absent. The first pinned attempt source-confirmed
15/20 files; bounded replays recovered the remaining 5, including one path that
needed three attempts. The recovery runs used 3,688,534 tokens and 111 candidate
calls in total. Coverage accounting records `files_examined` and
`source_action_files`; selected or dispatched files alone are never counted as
examined.

The pinned replay's only hunter-submitted report, in `hdsenc.c`, was rejected
offline. `parse_header` bounds every tag, returns `AVERROR_INVALIDDATA` whenever
metadata is absent, and processes header output produced by the nested FLV muxer.
No NULL-metadata manifest path or attacker-controlled memory violation survives.
The hunter had already marked both relevant candidates rejected before filing;
`candidate-ledger-source-retry-active-v1` now prevents that control-flow error at
runtime without adding standing prompt text.

The completed continuation consumed 9,025,918 tokens and 261 raw candidate calls
through rank 156, with no hunter-submitted findings. Offline source triage rejected
the usual incomplete hypotheses but recovered one complete new root cause from
the candidate funnel:

- `af_arnndn.c` accepts `denoise_output->nb_neurons` from 0 through 128 while
  validating only the separate VAD output shape. During non-silent inference,
  `compute_dense` writes that many floats into `g[NB_BANDS]`, a 22-float stack
  array. A syntactically valid model declaring 23 outputs deterministically causes
  an ASan stack-buffer-overflow in `compute_dense`; the ASan object report names
  `g` as the overwritten buffer. The production validator independently advanced
  the source report at high severity.

Build and run the target-blind reproducer with:

```bash
uv run python evaluations/run_ffmpeg_arnndn_reproducer.py \
  --ffmpeg .reference/ffmpeg/ffmpeg \
  --model-output /tmp/clearwing-arnndn-23.model \
  --output results/sourcehunt-optimization/ffmpeg-dynamic-validation/arnndn-denoise-output-stack-overflow.json
```

The structured crash artifact is
`results/sourcehunt-optimization/ffmpeg-dynamic-validation/arnndn-denoise-output-stack-overflow.json`.
The vulnerable and fixed-control `af_arnndn.c` files are byte-identical, so the
issue persists in both checked snapshots.

The three-case validator replay advanced Vulkan at medium and arnndn at high, but
rejected H.264 after incorrectly treating `top_borders[-1]` as a previous-row
element. The upstream H.264 fix commit documents that `top_borders` has only
`mb_width` elements and the access underflows its allocation by 96 bytes (with
writes at negative offsets). Keep H.264 as source-confirmed and record this replay
as a validator false negative. Current honest totals are three confirmed root
causes, one dynamically crash-confirmed.

### Exact-path wave 181–204 and three blind dynamic discoveries

The next sealed manifest selected 24 previously unseen production files by exact
path. Thirteen targets performed successful source-bearing actions on the first
attempt. Exact-path replays recovered seven, then two, then the final two; the
full wave is therefore 24/24 source-confirmed. The three recovery passes used
2,336,138 tokens and 66 raw candidate calls. As in the earlier recovery,
`files_hunted` was not accepted as coverage evidence.

This wave produced three source-supported issues, all found without CVE, patch,
fixed-checkout, historical-location, or survivor context and all independently
reproduced under ASan:

- RTP/QDM2 accepts a packet-controlled `block_size` smaller than its mandatory
  reconstructed header. A one-byte block yields `negative-size-param (size=-1)`
  in `qdm2_parse_packet`. Linking the later upstream minimum-size check ahead of
  the sealed static library makes the identical harness return invalid data with
  no sanitizer report. The later upstream commit describes the same invariant as
  an out-of-array access.
- `ahistogram` signed-logarithmic binning maps a valid positive full-scale sample
  to `bin == width` for even widths. A constant `+1.0` source with
  `ascale=log:hmode=sign` produces an eight-byte heap-buffer-overflow exactly one
  element past the histogram allocation. The issue is present in both sealed
  snapshots.
- XPSNR's downsampled high-pass stencil steps by two over odd active boundary
  dimensions but reads through `x + 3` and `y + 3`. Two valid 2049x1153 YUV444
  frames produce a two-byte heap-buffer-overflow read beyond the tightly allocated
  temporal source plane. The issue is present in both sealed snapshots.

Structured artifacts live under
`results/sourcehunt-optimization/ffmpeg-dynamic-validation/`, and the generic
reproducer entry points are `run_ffmpeg_qdm2_reproducer.py`,
`run_ffmpeg_ahistogram_reproducer.py`, and `run_ffmpeg_xpsnr_reproducer.py` in
`evaluations/`. The vulnerable-source-only survivor file now contains six cases.
Repeated validator calls show meaningful variance on the H.264 and Vulkan impact
axes even while source reality/triggerability remain supported, so no single
validator vote should be used as the prompt-optimization objective. Keep upstream
fix evidence, dynamic evidence, and independent source-only validation as separate
signals.

Current honest totals are 204 distinct source-confirmed files, six confirmed root
causes, and four dynamically crash-confirmed issues. H.264 and Vulkan still need
their older dynamic proofs; broad FFmpeg coverage beyond rank 204 remains open.

### Blind wave 205–228

The next sealed exact-path wave completed 24/24 source-confirmed on its first pass,
using 5,028,744 tokens and 147 candidate calls. It made no formal submissions, but
offline terminal-ledger triage recovered one complete denial-of-service root cause:

- `ff_rdt_parse_header` accepts a zero-length RDT status packet because it checks
  only `pkt_len > len`. The loop then advances `buf`, `len`, and `consumed` by zero
  and sees the identical status header forever. A 16-byte direct harness times out
  deterministically on both sealed snapshots. This is a remotely supplied CPU
  denial rather than memory corruption.

The candidate-ledger remains useful even when the small model does not complete a
formal report: XPSNR and RDT were both recovered from source-grounded terminal
hypotheses. Current totals are 228 distinct source-confirmed files, seven confirmed
root causes, and five dynamically reproduced issues.

### Blind waves 229–276 and four additional dynamic confirmations

Two more sealed exact-path waves completed with the unchanged
`candidate-ledger-source-retry-active-v1` scaffold, the
`compact-small-model-v1` context, 24 hunter steps, a 4,096-token output cap,
temperature zero, and no answer-bearing inputs. Ranks 229–252 were 24/24
source-confirmed, used 4,952,368 tokens, and produced 155 candidate calls.
Ranks 253–276 were also 24/24 source-confirmed, used 4,563,131 tokens, and
produced 158 candidate calls plus one formal finding.

Offline triage and production-code reproducer work confirmed four new root
causes:

- RDT's AAC cache path can copy a 9,212-byte unconsumed record tail into an
  8,256-byte `PayloadContext.buffer`. RTSP admits and forwards substantially
  larger interleaved records. A direct production-parser harness reports the
  heap-buffer-overflow on both sealed snapshots.
- A zero-sized `tfra` atom for an unknown track makes `ismindex` seek to the
  same position and repeat `read_tfra` forever. Both snapshot harnesses time
  out. This is a real but low-impact issue in a local indexing tool.
- The `entropy` filter allocates `1 << depth` histogram entries and indexes
  them with an unmasked stored 16-bit sample. A gray10le sample of 1,024
  accesses the first eight bytes beyond its 1,024-entry allocation. The formal
  blind hunter report was reproduced through the production ffmpeg filter graph
  under ASan on both snapshots.
- CAF's variable-packet seek callback fails to handle the documented negative
  result from `av_index_search_timestamp`. A forward seek beyond the final
  packet dereferences `index_entries[-1]`. A 107-byte syntactically parsed CAF
  followed by public `av_seek_frame` produces an eight-byte ASan heap-buffer-
  overflow read in `read_seek` on both snapshots.

The CAF case is especially useful scaffold evidence: the small model recorded
and validated the exact negative-index candidate in its terminal ledger but did
not submit it before the step cap. As with XPSNR and RDT, terminal candidate
state therefore remains valuable even when formal finding yield understates
discovery quality.

The ten-case vulnerable-source-only survivor replay (before adding CAF) advanced
8/10 reports. Entropy passed all four axes at high confidence. H.264 remained a
validator false negative, and the validator correctly identified the `ismindex`
loop as real and triggerable while rejecting it on security impact. This again
supports keeping source proof, dynamic reproduction, and validator votes as
separate signals instead of optimizing toward one validator decision.

At this checkpoint, ranks 1–276 are source-confirmed. The honest totals are
eleven confirmed root causes, nine dynamically reproduced issues, and two
source-only issues awaiting older dynamic proofs. The next manifest excludes
every prior bounded target found across all instrumentation ledgers and seals
the deterministic ranks 277–300 by exact path.

### Blind waves 277–324 and three more confirmed root causes

The unchanged frozen treatment completed two further exact-path waves:

| Ranks | Source-confirmed | Tokens | Candidate calls | Formal findings |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 277–300 | 24/24 | 4,589,393 | 165 | 0 |
| 301–324 | 24/24 | 4,344,701 | 129 | 0 |

Before selecting ranks 301–324, the deterministic selector was audited by
excluding every bounded target recorded in all campaign instrumentation
ledgers. It reproduced the already sealed 277–300 manifest exactly, then
selected the next 24 paths. This is now the required procedure for future
waves; rank offsets and historical `files_hunted` counters are not coverage
evidence.

Terminal-ledger triage and independent production-code validation confirmed
three additional root causes:

- The Dolby Vision RPU parser accepts long signed fixed-point coefficients, but
  the generator passes their integer components to a signed Golomb writer whose
  documented domain is only 16 bits. The generator also reserves a constant 177
  bytes for an MMR piece despite coefficient-dependent Golomb lengths. A
  parser-to-metadata-to-generator harness produces undefined bit-writer shifts
  followed by the always-on `flush_put_bits` assertion on both snapshots. Treat
  this conservatively as denial of service, not demonstrated heap corruption.
- `showfreqs=data=delay` starts its group-delay loop at frequency bin zero while
  reading `fft_data[ch][f-1]`. A normal production filter invocation produces a
  four-byte ASan heap-buffer-overflow read eight bytes before the FFT allocation
  on both snapshots. This is an unambiguous memory-safety defect but has limited
  security impact because the value affects only visualization output.
- HLS SAMPLE-AES accepts the 13-bit ADTS frame length without checking it against
  the remaining packet. That length directly determines the in-place AES block
  count. A 64-byte packet declaring an 8,191-byte frame produces an ASan heap-
  buffer-overflow in the production AES decryption routine on both sealed
  snapshots. Although later repository history contains a validating change,
  neither history nor later source was exposed to the hunter.

The corresponding generic recorders are
`run_ffmpeg_dovi_rpu_reproducer.py`,
`run_ffmpeg_showfreqs_reproducer.py`, and
`run_ffmpeg_hls_sample_aes_reproducer.py` under `evaluations/`. Structured
artifacts are retained under
`results/sourcehunt-optimization/ffmpeg-dynamic-validation/`.

The complete vulnerable-source-only `v11` survivor replay evaluated all 14
cases. It advanced 10/14: HLS SAMPLE-AES advanced at high severity, while
`showfreqs`, `ismindex`, XPSNR, and Dolby Vision were rejected on impact or
general reachability rather than source reality. These votes are useful triage,
not ground truth. The replay artifact is
`results/sourcehunt-optimization/ffmpeg-survivor-validation/deepseek-v4-flash-0731-vulnerable-v11.json`.

Current honest totals are 324 distinct source-confirmed files, 14 confirmed root
causes, and 12 dynamically reproduced issues. H.264 and Vulkan HEVC remain the
two source-only cases. Open-ended FFmpeg exhaustion is not close: this is strong
bounded progress, not a claim that the remaining production source has been
comprehensively audited.

### Blind wave 325–348 and Musepack SV7 confirmation

The audited selector excluded 324 unique bounded paths from every campaign
instrumentation ledger, then reproduced the sealed 301–324 manifest exactly
when that set was withheld from the exclusion. Only after that replay passed did
it seal ranks 325–348. The unchanged treatment completed all 24 targets with
source-bearing actions, using 4,352,353 tokens and 129 candidate/finding calls.

This wave produced one successful formal report and dynamic confirmation:

- Musepack SV7 stores an 11-bit `lastframelen` from file extradata without
  constraining it to `MPC_FRAME_SIZE` (1,152). The decoder allocates planar S16
  storage for 1,152 samples, synthesizes that fixed amount, and then publishes
  as many as 2,047 samples when the packet marks itself as the last frame. A
  public `avcodec_send_packet`/`avcodec_receive_frame` harness receives
  `nb_samples=2047`; a normal consumer loop immediately produces a two-byte
  ASan heap-buffer-overflow read at the end of each 2,304-byte channel plane on
  both snapshots.

The reproducer and recorder are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_mpc7_lastframelen_reproducer.c` and
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_mpc7_lastframelen_reproducer.py`. Current honest totals
are 348 distinct source-confirmed files, 15 confirmed root causes, and 13
dynamically reproduced issues. H.264 and Vulkan HEVC remain source-only.

The complete vulnerable-source-only `v12` survivor replay evaluated all 15
cases and advanced 14/15. Musepack advanced at medium severity. `showfreqs` was
the only rejection, failing the general and impactful axes while passing real
and triggerable. XPSNR, `ismindex`, and Dolby Vision advanced in this replay
after being rejected in `v11`, reinforcing that validator votes are variable
triage signals rather than ground truth. The replay artifact is
`results/sourcehunt-optimization/ffmpeg-survivor-validation/deepseek-v4-flash-0731-vulnerable-v12.json`.

### Blind wave 349–372

The audited selector found 348 unique bounded paths across all campaign
instrumentation ledgers. With the 325–348 set withheld, it reproduced that
sealed manifest exactly before selecting the next 24 deterministic unseen
paths. The unchanged frozen treatment completed 24/24 targets with
source-bearing actions, using 4,334,219 tokens and 132 candidate calls. It
produced no formal findings, and focused source triage did not establish a new
root cause. All 24 target files are byte-identical in the independent control
snapshot, so that comparison provides no differential evidence. Current honest
totals are 372 distinct source-confirmed files, 15 confirmed root causes, and
13 dynamically reproduced issues.

### Blind wave 373–396

The selector audit collected 396 unique bounded paths from every SourceHunt
optimization instrumentation ledger. With the 373–396 set withheld, the current
deterministic ranker reproduced the sealed manifest exactly. The same audit also
reproduced the 325–348 and 349–372 manifests when each was withheld, so the
selection state is internally consistent across the last three waves.

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 targets with successful
source-bearing actions. It used 4,335,583 tokens, made 137 candidate calls, and
submitted no formal findings. Focused review rejected the strongest terminal
leads: image-dimension validation prevents the suspected BMP stride overflow;
AFIR's exponential partition growth keeps its segment count below 1,024;
signature category counts sum exactly to the fixed 380/348 capacities; x264's
SEI callback owns and frees the transferred payloads; and Pixlet's scratch copies
are byte counts covered by its 16-element margin. The FFV1 Vulkan encoder would
benefit from defensive CPU-side validation of GPU-returned slice lengths, but no
attacker-controlled route to an overlarge length or concrete violated allocation
invariant was established, so it is not promoted.

All 24 wave files are byte-identical in the independent control snapshot. No new
root cause was established. Current honest totals are 396 distinct
source-confirmed files, 15 confirmed root causes, and 13 dynamically reproduced
issues. Relative to the 4,995-file deterministic ranked corpus, bounded coverage
is 7.9%, with 4,599 ranked files remaining.

### Blind wave 397–420 and LCL/ZLIB disclosure confirmation

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 exact-path targets with
source-bearing actions. It used 4,453,854 tokens, made 135 candidate calls, and
submitted no formal finding. The all-ledger audit found exactly 420 bounded
paths, and withholding this wave reproduced its sealed manifest exactly (as did
withholding each earlier exact-path wave from ranks 205–396). All 24 files are
byte-identical in the independent control snapshot.

Offline terminal-ledger triage confirmed one additional root cause:

- LCL/ZLIB's multithread decoder accepts valid zlib streams whose actual outputs
  are shorter than the packet's claimed half-frame size. `zlib_decomp` returns
  the short positive count, both call sites discard it, and the decoder then
  marks the entire decompression allocation as valid image data. A public
  16x16 RGB24 decoder harness supplies two three-byte streams; FFmpeg returns a
  768-byte frame containing the six supplied bytes plus all 762 bytes of the
  otherwise uninitialized allocation. ASan's deterministic malloc-fill marker
  confirms the complete disclosure on both sealed snapshots.

The generic reproducer and recorder are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_lcl_multithread_reproducer.c` and
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_lcl_multithread_reproducer.py`; structured artifacts
are under `results/sourcehunt-optimization/reproducers/`. The case is retained
as dynamically reproduced even though no sanitizer crash is expected: the
security effect is exposure of initialized allocator contents through a public
decoded-frame contract.

The other terminal leads were rejected after source proof. PAF motion blocks
have explicit source-page end checks; bounded bytestream access prevents GDV LZ
copies from leaving its frame allocation; HEVC intra-prediction callers provide
the required doubled top/left border arrays; swscale swizzles are internally
constructed from component indices zero through three; and the reviewed VVC,
RTSP, Vulkan FFV1, RALF, median, MJPEG Huffman, H.264 CAVLC, and V4L2 candidates
are covered by the producer bounds described in the campaign triage record.

Current honest totals are 420 distinct source-confirmed files, 16 confirmed root
causes, and 14 dynamically reproduced issues. H.264 and Vulkan HEVC remain the
two source-only cases. Relative to the 4,995-file deterministic corpus, bounded
coverage is 8.4%, with 4,575 files remaining. The audited next exact-path
manifest seals ranks 421–444 without changing prompts, scaffold, or context.

### Blind wave 421–444

The unchanged treatment completed 24/24 targets with successful source-bearing
actions, using 4,601,980 tokens and 140 candidate calls with no formal findings.
Peak estimated context remained 11,956 tokens; the largest individual input was
16,049 tokens. All 24 source files are byte-identical in the control snapshot.

Focused terminal-ledger review did not establish another root cause. The AAC
encoder's largest scale-factor band is exactly the 96-entry quantization scratch
capacity, and short-window grouping keeps its `w * 16 + g` metadata within 128
entries. TrueMotion2 checks Huffman literal counts and token bounds, constrains
motion blocks to the picture, and allocates explicit luma/chroma edge padding.
DV stops at `pos >= 64` before indexing the coefficient block. D3D12 decode's
32-entry barrier stack cannot overflow under any registered codec because each
sets `max_num_ref` to 17 or less, leaving room for its two leading output
barriers. E-AC-3's copy span and extension span are multiples of 12 bins, keeping
the maximum copy-section count below `SPX_MAX_BANDS` (17). TIFF's LZW encoder
checks its remaining output bound and propagates failure. Android MediaCodec's
input/output capacity observations depend on the platform codec violating its
own buffer contract and are not attacker-media routes in this encoder path.

The all-ledger selector audit now finds exactly 444 unique bounded paths, none
outside the deterministic corpus. Withholding each sealed exact-path wave from
ranks 205–444 reproduces it exactly. Current totals remain 16 confirmed root
causes and 14 dynamically reproduced issues. Coverage is 444/4,995 (8.9%), with
4,551 ranked files remaining. The next sealed manifest contains ranks 445–468.

### Blind wave 445–468

The first pass completed successful source-bearing actions for 19/24 targets.
Two exact-path recovery passes covered the remaining five and then two paths,
so the merged wave is 24/24 source-confirmed. Across all three passes it used
3,563,833 tokens, made 103 candidate calls, and submitted no formal findings.
All 24 target files are byte-identical in the independent control snapshot.

Focused terminal-ledger review did not establish another root cause. VC-1's
bitplanes are allocated for `mb_stride * FFALIGN(mb_height, 2)`, covering the
decoder's `mb_stride * mb_height` writes. MS Video 1 visits only complete 4x4
blocks and its bottom-up row arithmetic stays inside those blocks. Rawvideo's
sub-16-bit expansion writes either at most the copied packet size or exactly
`width * height` 16-bit samples into an allocation at least as large as the
computed frame. The audio equalizer validates channel indices and its four
section-history accesses match the four-element arrays. DTS-to-PTS creates a
fresh null tree-node holder on every removal iteration, so the suspected reuse
of a non-null removal node does not occur. HQX dispatches exactly 16 slice jobs
for its 16-element slice state, ZMBV's previous-frame allocation includes its
configured motion-search margins, and ClearVideo's copy helpers reject source
or destination rectangles outside the coded frame.

The all-ledger selector audit now finds exactly 468 unique bounded paths, none
outside the 4,995-file deterministic corpus. Withholding every sealed
exact-path wave from ranks 205–468 regenerates it exactly. Totals remain 16
confirmed root causes and 14 dynamically reproduced issues. Coverage is
468/4,995 (9.4%), with 4,527 ranked files remaining. The unchanged next exact-
path manifest seals ranks 469–492.

### Blind wave 469–492

The first pass completed successful source-bearing actions for 11/24 targets.
Several other hunters incorrectly claimed that source tools were unavailable
despite receiving their schemas, then reasoned from model memory and mentioned
historical CVEs. Those trajectories are not coverage or vulnerability evidence.
An exact-path replay recovered all 13 misses, making the merged wave 24/24
source-confirmed. The two passes used 4,102,069 tokens and made 132 candidate
calls, with no formal findings. All 24 target files are byte-identical in the
independent control snapshot.

Focused terminal-ledger review did not establish another root cause. HEVC's
unguarded center collocated-MV lookup remains inside the picture: SPS parsing
requires width and height to be multiples of the minimum coding block, boundary
quadtrees must split until their leaves fit, and every prediction partition is
contained by such a leaf. AAC rejects `max_sfb > num_swb`, selects matching
short- or long-window offset tables, and bounds the flattened group arrays to
128 entries. H.261 constrains each motion estimate to -15 through 15, so the
successive-vector difference stays within the 64-entry VLC table. PP7 allocates
its temporary surface for aligned luma geometry, which dominates every chroma
stride and height used by the same buffer. Spectrumsynth allocates a two-window
overlap buffer. Unsharp allocates `width + 2 * steps_x` columns and per-thread
row state matching its inclusive loop ranges and dispatch count. DXVA2 copies
slices into driver buffers only after checking each slice plus start code
against the remaining capacity.

RTMP-over-HTTP's signed capacity arithmetic deserves hardening but did not
survive the promotion gate. The normal RTMPT write path flushes after ten FLV
packets by default; even with a caller-selected larger flush interval, the
capacity-doubling expression reaches signed overflow while the requested total
is still below `INT_MAX`, causing allocation failure and state reset before a
demonstrated `out_size + size` wrap can reach `memcpy`. The reviewed swscale,
test-source, motion-estimation, IDet, Vulkan H.265, ASF, 4XM, WAV, WavPack, SGA,
MVHA, Fraps, SDP, and qt-faststart leads likewise resolved to producer bounds,
format/plane contracts, bounded allocation failure, or no attacker-media route.

The all-ledger selector audit finds exactly 492 unique bounded paths, none
outside the 4,995-file deterministic corpus. Withholding ranks 469–492
regenerates the sealed manifest exactly. Totals remain 16 confirmed root causes
and 14 dynamically reproduced issues. Coverage is 492/4,995 (9.85%), with
4,503 ranked files remaining. The unchanged next exact-path manifest seals
ranks 493–516.

### Blind wave 493–516 and `af_join` use-after-free confirmation

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 exact-path targets with
successful source-bearing actions on its first pass. It used 4,318,609 tokens,
made 133 candidate/finding calls, and submitted one formal finding. The
WS-SND1 fast path does logically read four bytes beyond the declared packet
payload because its length check does not subtract the four-byte header. It is
not retained as a security finding: FFmpeg's decoder API requires at least
`AV_INPUT_BUFFER_PADDING_SIZE` initialized zero bytes after packet data, so the
bounded read stays inside the caller-provided padding and cannot fault or expose
adjacent data under the contract.

Offline terminal-ledger triage recovered and dynamically confirmed a different
root cause in `libavfilter/af_join.c`. Its unique-buffer loop compares `j == i`
after searching only `nb_buffers` entries. With a valid map that sends one input
plane to two early output channels and a different input plane to a later output
channel, the duplicate makes `i` diverge from `nb_buffers`; the later unique
plane is omitted from the output frame's `AVBufferRef` list. `try_push_frame`
then frees both input frames after delivering the output, leaving that later
plane dangling.

A public libavfilter graph with two mono `abuffer` inputs,
`join=inputs=2:channel_layout=3.0:map=0.0-FL|0.0-FR|1.0-FC`, and an
`abuffersink` demonstrates the complete lifetime violation. The sink receives a
three-channel frame whose first two data pointers are identical and whose third
plane has no owning buffer reference. Reading the third channel normally after
retrieval produces an ASan heap-use-after-free, with the free stack in
`af_join`'s activation path. This reproduces on both sealed snapshots because
the source is identical; it is a real valid-configuration bug, not differential
evidence for the selected commits. The generic harness and recorder are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_af_join_uaf_reproducer.c` and
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_af_join_uaf_reproducer.py`; structured vulnerable and
control records are under `results/sourcehunt-optimization/reproducers/`.

The remaining strongest terminal candidates did not pass the promotion gate.
MV30's coefficient and motion-vector consumers use checked `bytestream2` reads,
which stop at the end and return zero. SIPR's mode-specific first-subframe pitch
indexes decode to at most `PITCH_DELAY_MAX`, and later indexes are clipped
around that prior lag. Xstack includes every configured placement rectangle
when deriving output dimensions. RTP iLBC accepts only 38- or 50-byte frames and
derives its per-packet frame cap from payload capacity. VP9's parsed three-bit
reference indexes address eight reference-frame state entries; the four-entry
array is for semantic reference types and is indexed independently. Network
parallelism is clamped to its three-entry arrays, VQC remains within its full
frame-sized vector allocation, and the reviewed LV2, packet dictionary, Dirac,
Theora, NVDEC, Vulkan encode, FLV, Bink, Opus PVQ, RL2, CBS VP9, and SRTP paths
did not establish an attacker-controlled violated allocation or lifetime
invariant.

All 24 wave files are byte-identical in the independent control snapshot. The
all-ledger selector audit now finds exactly 516 unique bounded paths, none
outside the 4,995-file deterministic corpus. Withholding ranks 493–516
regenerates its sealed manifest exactly. Current totals are 17 confirmed root
causes and 15 dynamically reproduced issues; H.264 and Vulkan HEVC remain the
two source-only cases. Coverage is 516/4,995 (10.33%), with 4,479 ranked files
remaining. The unchanged exact-path manifest for ranks 517–540 has SHA-256
`a0ec534215e2811bd88e5e2a903fb9efab4471f981e63fcb7fa60d931dcf9031`.

### Blind wave 517–540 and DNN output-shape overflow confirmation

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 exact-path targets with
successful source-bearing actions on its first pass. It used 4,375,440 tokens,
made 127 candidate/finding calls, and submitted one formal finding. Peak
estimated context was 11,972 tokens. All 24 target files are byte-identical in
the independent control snapshot.

The formal JV report was rejected dynamically. A 64x64 frame with the minimum
accepted 16-byte video stream and recursive block selectors passes the
decoder's initial size guard and returns a decoded frame without a sanitizer
report on either snapshot. This build uses `CONFIG_SAFE_BITSTREAM_READER=1`;
the bit index clamps at `size_in_bits + 8`, and cache reads remain within the
required packet padding. The production diagnostic and structured records are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_jv_bitstream_reproducer.c`,
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_jv_bitstream_reproducer.py`, and the corresponding
`ffmpeg_jv_bitstream_*` JSON files under
`results/sourcehunt-optimization/reproducers/`.

Offline terminal-ledger triage instead confirmed a model-file-reachable heap
overflow in `libavfilter/dnn/dnn_io_proc.c`. Both the TensorFlow and OpenVINO
backends pass model-declared output tensor dimensions to
`ff_proc_from_dnn_to_frame` without validating the output channel count against
the RGB frame format. In the NCHW path, `middle_data` is allocated as
`frame_width * frame_height * output_channels`, but RGB conversion always
processes `frame_width * 3` elements per row and later addresses three planes.
A one-channel NCHW output tensor for a four-by-four RGB24 frame therefore
produces an ASan heap-buffer-overflow in the production postprocessor on both
snapshots. The same path also passes `&middle_data`, a one-pointer stack object,
to the four-plane `sws_scale` API; an instrumented build reports that independent
stack-array contract violation first. The focused recorder compiles the
production postprocessor without ASan only to pass that earlier violation and
let instrumented libswscale expose the dimension-dependent heap access.

The reproducer and recorder are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_dnn_output_shape_reproducer.c` and
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_dnn_output_shape_reproducer.py`; structured vulnerable
and control records are under `results/sourcehunt-optimization/reproducers/`.
The sealed snapshots were built without the optional TensorFlow or OpenVINO
backend, so this is a production-function and backend-source proof rather than
an end-to-end model-loader run. The trigger is a local DNN model file, analogous
to the retained ARNNDN model-file issue, rather than ordinary media alone.

The remaining terminal leads did not establish another violated invariant.
The encoder framework rejects audio frames larger than `avctx->frame_size`
before libopus channel remapping. FIC bounds slice offsets and sizes against its
packet allocation and zero-initializes rejected entries. APE falls back from
nonpositive final sizes and rejects aligned packet sizes above `INT_MAX`.
MediaCodec copies depend on platform buffer metadata and allocation contracts;
no media-controlled size bypass was established. Vulkan slice storage grows
before each copy and its shared context uses refstruct ownership. BFI and BMV
check destination spans, DCA supplies the required LFE history prefix, LRC
scans a NUL-terminated `AVBPrint`, and the reviewed HEVC/VVC, VLC multitable,
LPC, IMF CPL, APV, AMF, ATRAC, Xan, memory-utility, and encoder-side-data paths
resolved to producer bounds or API contracts.

The all-ledger selector audit finds exactly 540 unique bounded paths, none
outside the 4,995-file deterministic corpus. Withholding ranks 517–540
regenerates its sealed manifest exactly. Current totals are 18 confirmed root
causes and 16 dynamically reproduced issues; H.264 and Vulkan HEVC remain the
two source-only cases. Coverage is 540/4,995 (10.81%), with 4,455 ranked files
remaining. The next unchanged exact-path manifest seals ranks 541–564.

### Blind wave 541–564 and MagicYUV prior-frame disclosure confirmation

The frozen treatment again completed 24/24 exact-path targets with successful
source-bearing actions on its first pass. It used 4,876,442 tokens, made 145
candidate-ledger updates, and submitted no formal findings. Peak estimated
context was 11,969 tokens, and the largest individual request was 17,061
tokens. This is another case where terminal state materially understated the
blind hunter's useful discovery yield.

Offline review confirmed a complete information-disclosure root cause in
`libavcodec/magicyuv.c`. For compressed slices, `READ_PLANE` decodes each row
only while `get_bits_left(&gb) > 0`, but neither the macro nor its caller
requires the decoded pixel count to reach the declared row width. The decoder
continues through prediction, ignores every slice worker's return value, sets
`got_frame`, and publishes the full frame.

A public libavcodec harness first decodes a valid raw 16x16 gray MagicYUV frame,
unrefs it into FFmpeg's frame pool, and then supplies a 300-byte frame with a
valid Huffman table but a two-byte compressed slice containing zero coded
pixels. The second decode succeeds. Its left predictor transforms all 256 stale
pixels from the previous pooled frame in a reversible way; the harness verifies
the expected transformed value at every pixel. Thus an attacker-controlled
truncated frame discloses the complete prior decoded frame through the normal
output contract. The reproducer and recorder are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_magicyuv_truncated_slice_reproducer.c` and
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_magicyuv_truncated_slice_reproducer.py`; structured
records are under `results/sourcehunt-optimization/reproducers/`. The behavior
is sanitizer-clean and reproduces on both byte-identical snapshots, as expected
for disclosure of valid pooled memory rather than an out-of-allocation access.

The other strongest ledger candidates resolved to existing bounds or API
contracts. DPX's global stride/height check covers its aligned per-row unpack
reads. MagicYUV slice offsets themselves are monotonically bounded; the missing
decoded-width invariant is the retained issue. H.264 MP4-to-Annex-B performs a
counting pass, rejects output sizes above `INT_MAX`, then allocates exactly that
size before its copy pass. Huffyuv masks or shifts high-bit-depth symbols into
its 16,384-entry VLC domain. JPEG-LS caps the run index at 31. SMPTE 436M caps
payload and sample counts before fixed-array copies. IAMF's custom layout is
allocated to the declared channel count and its final count is checked. The
reviewed UDP, MMAL, vectorscope, MPEG motion, HTTP authentication, Ut Video,
showwaves, CDToons, graph printing, LATM, ffmpeg muxing, CUDA thumbnail, generic
encryption info, ProRes, IFF, buffer pools, and H.264 CABAC paths did not
establish another attacker-controlled violated allocation or lifetime
invariant.

Coverage is now 564/4,995 (11.29%), with 4,431 ranked files remaining. Current
totals are 19 confirmed root causes and 17 dynamically reproduced issues;
H.264 slice sentinel collision and Vulkan HEVC RPS overflow remain source-only.

### Blind wave 565–588 and three memory-safety confirmations

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 exact-path targets with
successful source-bearing actions on its first pass. It used 4,320,458 tokens,
made 166 candidate/finding tool calls, and submitted one formal finding. The
511 model calls had a peak estimated context of 11,912 tokens and a largest
individual input of 17,409 tokens. All 24 targets are byte-identical in the
independent control snapshot.

The formal drawgraph report survived offline review and dynamic validation. The
filter resets its shared horizontal coordinate only inside the first metadata
series' successful parse path. If that primary metadata is missing while a
later configured series is present, the first iteration continues before the
reset, `s->x` still increments each frame, and the later series eventually
writes beyond the output width. A public two-pixel libavfilter graph produces
an ASan heap-buffer-overflow on its third frame on both snapshots. The harness,
recorder, and structured records are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_drawgraph_missing_primary_reproducer.c`,
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_drawgraph_missing_primary_reproducer.py`, and the
corresponding `ffmpeg_drawgraph_missing_primary_*` JSON files under
`results/sourcehunt-optimization/reproducers/`.

Offline terminal-ledger review confirmed two DNN defects. The shared output-name
parser allocates exactly four pointer slots, accepts four names, and then writes
a required NULL terminator into a fifth slot. TensorFlow detection explicitly
requires four outputs, so its intended configuration reaches the overflow during
`ff_dnn_init`, before backend lookup or model loading. The production-source
harness reproduces the ASan heap-buffer-overflow on both snapshots; it supplies
inert backend module stubs because the sealed builds omit optional TensorFlow.
The reproducer and recorder are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_dnn_output_names_reproducer.c` and
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_dnn_output_names_reproducer.py`.

TensorFlow request cleanup also computes the output count as
`sizeof(*output_tensors) / sizeof(output_tensors[0])`. Both operands describe one
pointer, so cleanup always deletes one tensor even though detection requires and
produces four. Sustained valid detection therefore leaks three complete output
tensors per frame. This remains source-confirmed because TensorFlow is absent
from the sealed builds.

Focused review then recovered another dynamically confirmed root cause from the
NellyMoser terminal candidate. Its trellis search caps `idx_max` with
`OPT_SIZE` but rejects only `idx > idx_max`, admitting the invalid one-past index
35,768. A short public white-noise encode with `volume=10` and `-trellis 1`
reaches the edge: UBSan reports invalid `opt` and `path` indices, and ASan catches
a four-byte read exactly after the complete 3,290,656-byte `opt` allocation.
Both snapshots reproduce it. The durable recorder is
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_nellymoser_trellis_reproducer.py`, with structured
`ffmpeg_nellymoser_trellis_*` records under the reproducer results directory.

The remaining terminal candidates resolved to bounds or contracts. EATGV's
short token reads remain within the decoder API's required zero padding, and Ogg
buffers include explicit input padding. RTP QCELP limits interleave indexes to
its six groups and bounds every 315-byte store and frame extraction. PAF bounds
block indexes and audio/video offsets against its allocations. IFV guards every
index-entry dereference and aborts incomplete index reads. APV checks each scan
position before coefficient access. CBS AV1 calculates allocation and copy sizes
from the same unit lengths. Channel-layout parsing grows storage by actual
entries and validates declared counts. The Torch request initializes both
tensor pointers and transfers input ownership to the tensor deleter. ATRAC3+,
Indeo 4, VVC intra/SEI, H.263 encoding, JPEG XL parsing, Movie, amix, RM muxing,
VAAPI encoding, LAME, and IPFS gateway likewise did not establish another
attacker-controlled violated memory or lifetime invariant.

The all-results selector audit finds exactly 588 unique bounded paths, none
outside the 4,995-file deterministic corpus. Withholding ranks 565–588
reproduces its sealed manifest exactly. Current totals are 23 confirmed root
causes and 20 dynamically reproduced issues; H.264 slice sentinel collision,
Vulkan HEVC RPS overflow, and the TensorFlow tensor leak remain source-only.
Coverage is 588/4,995 (11.77%), with 4,407 ranked files remaining. The unchanged
next exact-path manifest seals ranks 589–612 with SHA-256
`b3647d52c5674a82e58f8f95a82d74ee6f335dbef1319a1eeb0223bccb50b286`.

### Blind wave 589–612 and RTP/AV1 ignored-OBU heap overflow

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 exact-path targets with
successful source-bearing actions. It used 3,993,950 tokens over 447 model
calls, made 122 candidate/finding tool calls, and submitted no formal findings.
Peak estimated context was 11,995 tokens and the largest individual input was
18,525 tokens. All 24 target files are byte-identical in the independent
control snapshot.

Offline terminal-ledger review confirmed a heap-buffer-overflow in the RTP/AV1
depacketizer. Temporal-delimiter and tile-list OBUs enter an ignore branch that
increments `pktpos` by the declared OBU size and decrements `rem_pkt_size`, but
does not advance `buf_ptr`. The next loop iteration consequently parses bytes
inside the ignored OBU as a new element while the output cursor retains the
entire ignored-size gap. `av_grow_packet` accounts only for that newly parsed
element; the following OBU-header or payload write can therefore begin beyond
the packet allocation.

A direct production-handler harness supplies a 100-byte ignored temporal
delimiter followed by 17 trailing bytes. ASan reports a heap write 19 bytes
beyond an 81-byte allocation on both sealed snapshots. The reproducer,
recorder, and structured records are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_rtp_av1_ignored_obu_reproducer.c`,
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_rtp_av1_ignored_obu_reproducer.py`, and the
corresponding `ffmpeg_rtp_av1_ignored_obu_*` JSON files under
`results/sourcehunt-optimization/reproducers/`.

The remaining leads resolved to existing bounds or contracts. FastAudio
consumes exactly 320 bits from its ten 32-bit words. LUT2 input negotiation caps
both inputs at 12 bits per component, making its 24-bit table and index
consistent. Drawtext's real shifts produce only subpixel indices 0–15.
`fill_ones` has the allocation slack required by its stores. CENC's clear plus
protected arithmetic is signed-widened and monotonically bounded by the
remaining packet size. DPX allocation matches its format-specific writes.
SChannel grows buffers before reads and copies and clamps `SECBUFFER_EXTRA` to
the current input. MPC8's combinatorial traversal is limited by `k <= 16` and
`n <= 32`. Removegrain's SIMD span is `(width - 2) & ~15` with a scalar tail.
Swresample's initial-reflection allocation covers both extrema. The NAL
start-code vector scanner stays within its guarded loop and its relevant
callers provide the required padding. OH encoder output attributes remain
platform-owned, and the reviewed swscale vertical-ring candidates remained
producer-bounded.

The deterministic all-results selector audit now finds exactly 612 unique
bounded paths across 68 event ledgers, none outside the 4,995-file corpus.
Withholding ranks 589–612 reproduces their sealed manifest and hash exactly.
Current totals are 24 confirmed root causes and 21 dynamically reproduced
issues; H.264 slice sentinel collision, Vulkan HEVC RPS overflow, and the
TensorFlow tensor leak remain source-only. Coverage is 612/4,995 (12.25%), with
4,383 ranked files remaining. The next unchanged exact-path manifest seals
ranks 613–636 with SHA-256
`37bf25501605780e40c3f8efecdd3d8eb2fc048484269b230799e222f7aa41fd`.

### Blind wave 613–636 and three memory-safety confirmations

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 exact-path targets with
successful source-bearing actions. It used 4,461,162 tokens over 499 model
calls, made 136 candidate/finding tool calls, and submitted two formal
findings. Peak estimated context was 11,888 tokens, the largest individual
input was 17,045 tokens, and six automatic context compactions occurred. All
24 target files are byte-identical in the independent control snapshot.

Both formal reports survived source review and public-CLI dynamic validation.
In shufflepixels horizontal and vertical inverse modes, `nb_blocks` is the
ceiling of the plane dimension divided by the configured block size, but the
map has only one entry per plane pixel. The number of entries written at a
random destination is derived from the sequential input cursor. If an early
full-width input block is assigned to the final partial destination block, map
initialization writes beyond the allocation. Width 10, block width 4, and seed
1 produce an ASan four-byte write exactly after the 40-byte map allocation on
both snapshots; the vertical form reproduces as well. The durable recorder is
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_shufflepixels_inverse_reproducer.py`, with structured
`ffmpeg_shufflepixels_inverse_*` records under the reproducer results directory.

VIF's boundary mirroring similarly assumes that each image dimension can
support half the current filter width. A tap from its 17-wide scale-zero filter
can lie beyond twice a small dimension, so the one-step expression
`2 * dimension - index - 1` still yields an invalid index. No minimum size is
enforced before the vertical and horizontal float reads. Comparing two 2x2
gray frames through the public VIF graph produces an ASan four-byte read exactly
after a 16-byte allocation in `vif_filter1d` on both snapshots. The recorder
and records are `evaluations/run_ffmpeg_vif_small_frame_reproducer.py` and
`ffmpeg_vif_small_frame_*`.

Offline terminal-ledger review recovered a third issue from rate control. The
MPEG-family second-pass parser accepts `type:%d` from its passlog without
checking that the value is an `AVPictureType`, then `init_pass2` uses it to
index multiple five-entry statistics arrays. The recorder generates a normal
MPEG-2 first-pass log, changes the first record from `type:1` to `type:99`, and
runs the ordinary second-pass CLI path. Both snapshots report the index-99
violation under UBSan followed by an ASan eight-byte heap-buffer-overflow read
in `ff_rate_control_init`. Artifacts are
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_ratecontrol_stats_reproducer.py` and the structured
`ffmpeg_ratecontrol_stats_*` records.

The remaining ledger candidates resolved to existing bounds or contracts.
WAV PEAK output permits only one- or two-byte PCM, sizes each growth from the
channel count and bytes per sample, and disables output before the monotonic
buffer count can exceed `INT_MAX`; negating `INT16_MIN` is well-defined after
integer promotion and conversion back to `int16_t`. RTP/AV1 encoder fragments
copy exactly the current packet remainder only while the element is larger,
then retain the bounded final remainder. AC-3 parser reads are protected by
packet padding. H.264 picture timing maps at most three clock timestamps into
its three-entry array. DV's largest fixed profile equals
`DV_MAX_FRAME_SIZE`. SPP has aligned row slack for its eight-wide stores, and
ANLMS receives zeroed offset storage and doubled delay/coefficient rings.
CBS AV1 bounds tile-group endpoints by the parsed tile count. The reviewed
NVDEC, Vulkan H.264, SIPR, sync queue, OAPV, MPEG-1/2 encode, Lead, D3D12,
extract-extradata, CUVID, audio-3D-scope, and MIPS prediction paths did not
establish another violated memory or lifetime invariant. The optional
libaribcaption CLUT writes lack local guards, but upstream restricts foreground,
background, and stroke colors to one fixed 8-by-16 palette, so the 256-entry
destination cannot be exhausted.

The deterministic all-results selector audit now finds exactly 636 unique
bounded paths across 69 event ledgers, none outside the 4,995-file corpus.
Withholding ranks 613–636 reproduces their sealed manifest and hash exactly.
Current totals are 27 confirmed root causes and 24 dynamically reproduced
issues; H.264 slice sentinel collision, Vulkan HEVC RPS overflow, and the
TensorFlow tensor leak remain source-only. Coverage is 636/4,995 (12.73%), with
4,359 ranked files remaining. The next unchanged exact-path manifest seals
ranks 637–660 with SHA-256
`56946773e050d03038312840b9add8fe280cd82fbf2648c728c75cd09463824b`.

### Blind wave 637–660, decimate metric overflow, and Whisper queue overflow

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 exact-path targets with
successful source-bearing actions. It used 4,716,109 tokens over 533 model
calls, made 155 candidate/finding tool calls, and submitted no formal findings.
Peak estimated context was 11,916 tokens, the largest individual input was
16,550 tokens, and three automatic context compactions occurred. All 24 target
files are byte-identical in the independent control snapshot.

Offline terminal-ledger review dynamically confirmed a heap-buffer-overflow in
decimate's chroma metric calculation. The filter accepts a minimum block width
of four and allocates its metric grid using a luma half-block width of two. For
YUV411P chroma, horizontal subsampling right-shifts that value by two, producing
a zero loop step. The chroma loop therefore leaves `x` at zero while incrementing
`xdest` on every iteration, eventually indexing beyond the luma-sized metric
grid. A public 16x16 YUV411P graph with `decimate=blockx=4` produces an ASan
eight-byte access exactly after the 64-byte metric allocation on both sealed
snapshots. The durable recorder and structured records are
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_decimate_subsampled_block_reproducer.py` and the
corresponding `ffmpeg_decimate_subsampled_block_*` JSON files under the
reproducer results directory. Vertically subsampled YUV440P and YUV410P can
similarly erase the half-block height and reach division by zero; the retained
root cause uses the stronger memory-safety trigger.

The same ledger contained a second genuine overflow in the optional Whisper
filter. Its minimum 20 ms queue allocates 320 float samples. Whisper consumes
complete audio frames, and FFmpeg imposes no matching frame-size ceiling:
`asetnsamples` may validly emit as many as `INT_MAX` samples. When a single frame
is larger than the queue, the capacity guard transcribes at most the existing
fill and then unconditionally copies the complete new frame into the fixed
queue. A normal 1,024-sample frame therefore exceeds the minimum allocation.
The sealed builds omit whisper.cpp, so this case is retained as source-confirmed
rather than dynamically reproduced.

The strongest remaining candidates closed under their downstream contracts.
The FLIC video demuxer does ignore a failed full-size read after allocating its
packet, but the demux callback returns the EOF/error instead of releasing that
partially initialized packet to the decoder. NSV auxiliary sizes can underflow
the unsigned video size, but conversion to the signed packet API produces a
negative growth request that `av_grow_packet` rejects before allocation or
access. A crafted Opus code-3 CBR packet can similarly compute a negative frame
size, but range-decoder initialization rejects that size before reading, and no
unsafe parser consumer was established. The reviewed LUT3D, OpenVINO, GIF,
RTP, buffer-sink, MSMPEG4, SCPR, showspatial, RA288, H.264 picture, CBS SEI,
V4L2, YUV4MPEG, SMC encoder, ALAC, CDXL, HDR, Twofish, and IVI candidates did
not establish another distinct violated memory or lifetime invariant; the
OpenVINO output-shape lead overlaps the already retained generic NCHW output
shape root cause.

The deterministic all-results selector audit now finds exactly 660 unique
bounded paths across 70 event ledgers, none outside the 4,995-file corpus.
Withholding ranks 637–660 reproduces their sealed manifest and hash exactly.
Current totals are 29 confirmed root causes and 25 dynamically reproduced
issues; H.264 slice sentinel collision, Vulkan HEVC RPS overflow, the TensorFlow
tensor leak, and the Whisper oversized-frame overflow remain source-only.
Coverage is 660/4,995 (13.21%), with 4,335 ranked files remaining. The next
unchanged exact-path manifest seals ranks 661–684 with SHA-256
`86d85254f6934b18422d4cc950b5c2a76e9f6a87e1c1ae54abd44424cb8a03ac`.

### Blind wave 661–684 and DNN classification-count overflow

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 exact-path targets with
successful source-bearing actions. It used 4,006,739 tokens over 461 model
calls, made 124 candidate/finding tool calls, and submitted no formal
findings. Peak estimated context was 11,956 tokens, the largest individual
input was 15,626 tokens, and three automatic context compactions occurred.
All 24 target files are byte-identical in the independent control snapshot.

Offline terminal-ledger review dynamically confirmed a heap-buffer-overflow in
the DNN classification filter. Each production detection bounding box contains
exactly four classification-label and confidence slots, but
`dnn_classify_post_proc` indexes them with `bbox->classify_count` and increments
that count without enforcing the capacity. OpenVINO may derive its output count
directly from the loaded model, and its completion loop invokes the classifier
callback once for every output. A production-source harness invokes the same
callback five times on one production-allocated bounding-box side-data object.
The fifth callback produces an ASan eight-byte write exactly after the complete
660-byte allocation on both sealed snapshots. The reproducer, recorder, and
structured records are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_dnn_classify_count_reproducer.c`,
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_dnn_classify_count_reproducer.py`, and the corresponding
`ffmpeg_dnn_classify_count_*` JSON files under the reproducer results directory.
The OpenVINO completion loop also passes `outputs` instead of
`&outputs[output_i]`; that independent indexing error is not needed for the
confirmed repeated-callback overflow.

The remaining terminal candidates resolved to bounds or downstream contracts.
The X server does require each ZPixmap row to use its advertised scanline pad,
so xcbgrab's tightly packed SHM allocation is too small for some narrow
8-, 16-, and 24-bit captures. However, `ProcShmGetImage` computes that exact
padded length and checks it against the attached segment before calling
`GetImage`; an undersized segment receives `BadAccess` rather than an out-of-
bounds server write. The non-SHM reply carries the padded allocation, while
xcbgrab's tightly stepped cursor drawing remains inside the smaller logical
frame region. UTVideo's Huffman payload likewise cannot exceed its one-byte-per-
symbol buffer: a fixed eight-bit code is always a valid prefix code for the 256
byte symbols, so an optimal Huffman tree has weighted length at most eight bits
per input byte, and the extra four bytes cover alignment.

The `subfile,` option parser either selects the ordinary file protocol for the
short malformed forms or rejects an incomplete option sequence with its
pointers still inside the copied filename. Bink's unsigned remaining-size
underflow changes parsing, but `ffio_limit` bounds packet allocation and reads
to available input. IPMovie component sizes are 16-bit, their combined packet
allocation covers all three copies, and a negative short-audio size is rejected
by the packet API. SMC advances rows by the padded destination stride, keeping
previous-block references inside the allocated frame. Hap allocates the larger
of its complete texture and per-chunk Snappy worst case. PSX STR bounds its
16-bit sector index and count before the fixed-size sector copy; DXA caps its
frame size and allocates the header, palette, and frame together; and RL2's
validated index sizes remain representable by the index API. RTP Xiph and VP8,
SSIM, LADSPA, aphasemeter, DVB subtitle parsing, histeq, DShow, MPEG video DSP,
Bethsoft VID, random, sendcmd, and the reviewed codec utility paths likewise did
not establish another attacker-controlled violated memory or lifetime
invariant.

The deterministic all-results selector audit now finds exactly 684 unique
bounded paths across 71 event ledgers, none outside the 4,995-file corpus.
Withholding ranks 661–684 reproduces their sealed manifest and hash exactly.
Current totals are 30 confirmed root causes and 26 dynamically reproduced
issues. Coverage is 684/4,995 (13.69%), with 4,311 ranked files remaining. The
next unchanged exact-path manifest seals ranks 685–708 with SHA-256
`9e49f3ece93bb10739bda51586e545cda788ab4934910890dcb41159501ebe79`.

### Blind wave 685–708 and three packet/filter indexing overflows

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 exact-path targets with
successful source-bearing actions. It used 4,472,243 tokens over 503 model
calls, made 134 candidate/finding tool calls, and submitted one formal finding.
Peak estimated context was 11,893 tokens, the largest individual input was
16,425 tokens, and one automatic context compaction occurred. All 24 target
files are byte-identical in the independent control snapshot.

The formal finding is a dynamically confirmed out-of-bounds channel index in
the pan filter. `parse_channel_name` bounds the numbered `cN` syntax to
`MAX_CHANNELS`, but returns named `AVChannel` values without the same check.
Public named values include `UNK` at 768 and `AMBI0` at 1024, far above pan's
64-entry input-channel arrays. The public graph `pan=stereo|FL=AMBI0` first
reads `used_in_ch[1024]`; UBSan reports that exact index and ASan reports the
resulting invalid stack read on both sealed snapshots. If execution continues,
the following assignments write through the same invalid index in
`used_in_ch` and `pan->gain`. The durable CLI recorder and structured records
are `evaluations/run_ffmpeg_pan_named_channel_reproducer.py` and the
corresponding `ffmpeg_pan_named_channel_*` JSON files under the reproducer
results directory.

Offline terminal-ledger review dynamically confirmed two additional RTP
packetizer roots. LATM represents an AAC access-unit size with one header byte
per 255 payload bytes, but writes that complete variable-length header into the
fixed RTP packet buffer before fragmentation and never compares its size with
the buffer. Through the public RTP muxer, a 382,500-byte AAC packet and an
ordinary 1,472-byte packet sink produce a 1,501-byte header; ASan observes the
1,500-byte `memset` crossing the complete RTP allocation on both snapshots.
The reproducer and recorder are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_rtp_latm_header_reproducer.c` and
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_rtp_latm_header_reproducer.py`.

RFC2190 H.263 has a separate small-packet failure. Common RTP initialization
accepts every packet size above its 12-byte header, while the RFC2190
packetizer reserves another eight payload-header bytes. A valid 13-byte sink
therefore leaves one payload byte and derives a fragment size of negative
seven. That signed length reaches mode-B `memcpy`, where ASan reports
`negative-size-param` through the public muxer on both snapshots. The durable
artifacts are `evaluations/ffmpeg_rtp_h263_small_packet_reproducer.c`,
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_rtp_h263_small_packet_reproducer.py`, and the matching
structured records under the reproducer results directory.

The HEVC no-start-code candidate was based on a misread sentinel calculation.
`nal_find_startcode_internal` subtracts three from its local end pointer in
each of its first two loops and adds three back before the tail loop, so its
final `end + 3` is the caller's original end, not three bytes beyond it.
`nal_parse_units` consequently takes its normal end-of-input exit rather than
looping. JPEG-LS sizes its raw workspace at four bytes per component-pixel and
its escaped packet for the proven one-bit-per-15-input-bit maximum overhead.
vMix rounds frame storage to 16-pixel boundaries and validates both DC and AC
slice spans before its 8x8 writes. HQA similarly aligns its frame and confines
each of eight slice traversals to that storage. The GDI lead would require a
Windows desktop bitmap whose successful GDI allocation and reported geometry
already exceed signed packet-size representability; no realizable platform
configuration satisfying that chain was established. The reviewed FFV1,
ProRes RAW and Vulkan ProRes, VP9 probability, JPEG XL animation, V4L2, QSV,
FDK-AAC, Intrax8, AAP, amplify, OpenCL xfade, C93, movtext, and mptestsrc paths
likewise did not establish another violated memory or lifetime contract.

The deterministic all-results selector audit now finds exactly 708 unique
bounded paths across 72 event ledgers, none outside the 4,995-file corpus.
Withholding ranks 685–708 reproduces their sealed manifest and hash exactly.
Current totals are 33 confirmed root causes and 29 dynamically reproduced
issues. Coverage is 708/4,995 (14.17%), with 4,287 ranked files remaining. The
next unchanged exact-path manifest seals ranks 709–732 with SHA-256
`cfde32b2171a5b3e7f682090af7bce5fc770f6b7de30982193d02f0bf09635f5`.

### Blind wave 709–732 and framepack alpha-plane invalid write

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 exact-path targets with
successful source-bearing actions. It used 4,321,772 tokens over 485 model
calls, made 133 candidate/finding tool calls, and submitted one formal
finding. Peak estimated context was 11,977 tokens, the largest individual
input was 17,047 tokens, and four automatic context compactions occurred. All
24 target files are byte-identical in the independent control snapshot.

The formal MLZ finding was rejected during offline adjudication. Its bump
sequence reaches 32767 only after setting that value as the next bump code,
but 32767 is `MAX_CODE` and the earlier switch case flushes the dictionary;
the bump branch therefore cannot grow the accepted code range to 65536.
Independently, `decode_string` stores `match_len - 1` in an unsigned long, so a
zero-length dictionary entry becomes `ULONG_MAX` and is rejected by the
buffer-size comparison before the claimed preceding-byte write.

Offline terminal-ledger review instead dynamically confirmed an invalid write
in the framepack filter. Framepack explicitly advertises four-plane YUVA
formats, but its side-by-side packing helper initializes only `dst[0]` through
`dst[2]` before passing the four-entry array to `av_image_copy2`. The generic
image copier derives four planes from YUVA's pixel descriptor and writes the
alpha plane through the indeterminate `dst[3]` pointer. A public graph joining
two 16x16 `yuva420p` sources with `framepack=sbs` produces an ASan invalid write
through `image_copy_plane` on both sealed snapshots. The vertical helper has
the same unset destination pointer and additionally leaves `linesizes[3]`
unset; `framepack=tab` also aborts under ASan. The durable recorder and
structured records are
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_framepack_alpha_reproducer.py` and the corresponding
`ffmpeg_framepack_alpha_*` JSON files under the reproducer results directory.

The strongest remaining terminal candidates resolved to bounds or unreachable
states. FITS can store `NAXIS1` through `NAXIS999`, but its eight-byte keyword
field truncates `NAXIS1000` to `NAXIS100`; the exact sequence check rejects it
before indexing beyond `naxisn[998]`. Identity and mid-equalizer negotiate one
common pixel format for both inputs, while their plane dimensions and
histogram indices remain within the matching allocations. Curves validates
coordinates to `[0,1]`, requires strictly increasing scaled x positions, and
sizes its PCHIP work arrays for the derivative endpoint accesses. Convolution
caps its odd row or column matrix at 49 entries, matching its fixed pointer
array.

APAC's four-bit block length caps direct sample writes at 15 values in its
64-byte scratch block; oversized frame-sample arithmetic is rejected by the
audio buffer allocator. RoQ caps the chunk size before the packet-size
addition, and a wrapped negative allocation is rejected before its read.
XMV's unsigned video-size subtraction can weaken a container boundary, but its
frame-size field remains capped at 524,288 bytes and the packet API bounds the
actual read. MSCC's writer seek clamps to its allocation and its decoded-frame
buffers are sized from validated codec dimensions. OpenJPEG's packet writer
maintains `pos <= size`, and its component copy dimensions match the negotiated
frame layout. The swscale tail scratch plane holds 512 bytes, while a 32-pixel
block at its largest four-byte pixel type requires at most 128 bytes. The
reviewed libdav1d, D3D12 HEVC, H.264 motion prediction and metadata, MPJPEG,
SP5X, Targa, and generic format utility paths likewise did not establish
another violated memory or lifetime invariant. MPJPEG's `do`/`memcmp` shape
would be unsafe for a strict MIME boundary longer than its 2,048-byte scan
chunk, but FFmpeg's HTTP response parser truncates exported Content-Type lines
below that threshold; no public route to the oversized boundary was
established.

The deterministic all-results selector audit now finds exactly 732 unique
bounded paths across 73 event ledgers, none outside the 4,995-file corpus.
Withholding ranks 709–732 reproduces their sealed manifest and hash exactly.
Current totals are 34 confirmed root causes and 30 dynamically reproduced
issues. Coverage is 732/4,995 (14.65%), with 4,263 ranked files remaining. The
next unchanged exact-path manifest seals ranks 733–756 with SHA-256
`6883aabfd2be2a76c1ab5757c35c047e442415af67f3fd4c00cb225fbdaefe10`.

### Blind wave 733–756 and FFV1 remap-table out-of-bounds read

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 exact-path targets with
successful source-bearing actions. It used 4,479,873 tokens over 503 model
calls and made 141 candidate/finding tool calls, with no formal findings.
Peak estimated context was 11,880 tokens, the largest individual input was
17,541 tokens, and six automatic context compactions occurred. All 24 target
files are byte-identical in the independent control snapshot.

Offline terminal-ledger review dynamically confirmed a heap-buffer-overflow
read in FFV1 level-4 remapping. `decode_slice` allocates each 16-bit `fltmap`
for exactly `slice_width * slice_height` entries, and `decode_remap` records a
populated `remap_count` that need not be a power of two. `decode_plane` then
decodes symbols using `ceil(log2(remap_count))` bits and masks them to the next
power-of-two range without rejecting unused symbols. If `pixel_num` is below
that ceiling, an unused symbol is also beyond the physical allocation.

A public FFmpeg encode of one 513x1 `yuv444p16le` frame with FFV1 level 4 and
`remap_mode=1` creates the required non-power-of-two table shape. The
unmodified sample decodes normally. Flipping bit zero of packet byte 18—one
bit of entropy data, with the valid remap syntax left intact—causes
`decode_line` to produce an unused masked symbol and `decode_plane` to read two
bytes outside the lookup table. ASan reports the same heap-buffer-overflow on
both sealed snapshots. The durable harness, recorder, and structured records
are `evaluations/ffmpeg_ffv1_remap_reproducer.c`,
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_ffv1_remap_reproducer.py`, and the corresponding
`ffmpeg_ffv1_remap_*` artifacts under the reproducer results directory.

The other terminal candidates resolved to established invariants or
unreachable states. The QCP data path enters its packet branch only while the
unsigned data size is nonzero; size one yields a zero-length packet rather
than a negative allocation. WebM DASH requires at least one decimal stream
index before leaving its `parsing_streams` state, bounds that index by
`nb_streams`, and validates all supported codec identifiers before output.
DeckLink's VANC ownership is balanced: creation returns one COM reference,
`SetAncillaryData` retains it, the caller releases its reference, and the
frame destructor releases the stored reference. Abitscope dispatches literal
8-, 16-, 32-, or 64-bit sample widths from the negotiated format; its coarse
stored depth does not control those reads. Corr's shared pixel-format list
negotiates one format across both inputs. AAC short windows expose at most 15
scale-factor bands, so the eight 16-slot windows fit the 128-entry arrays.
FTR checks the accumulated channel offset before every plane copy. RTP HEVC
checks its two-byte payload header plus one byte before reading a FU header,
and its aggregate helper bounds every NAL length. WMA's fixed block length and
`BLOCK_MAX_SIZE` arrays cover its coefficient ranges. JPEG XL supplies libjxl
the actual FFmpeg buffer size and checks the external API result. The reviewed
VP5, VVC reference-list, SpeedHQ, RGB conversion, MIPS VP8, wavesynth, command
help, and device paths likewise did not establish another violated memory or
lifetime contract.

The deterministic all-results selector audit now finds exactly 756 unique
bounded paths across 74 event ledgers, none outside the 4,995-file corpus.
Withholding ranks 733–756 reproduces their sealed manifest and hash exactly.
Current totals are 35 confirmed root causes and 31 dynamically reproduced
issues. Coverage is 756/4,995 (15.14%), with 4,239 ranked files remaining.
The next unchanged exact-path manifest seals ranks 757–780 with SHA-256
`d73b8307b9ed87a96f6abffef992229da1b143bad4461f09d5065ec4e8a3c7aa`.

### Blind wave 757–780, partial-block overflows, and rav1e FFI UB

The unchanged frozen treatment completed all 24 exact-path targets with
successful source-bearing actions. It used 3,593,225 tokens over 420 model
calls, made 110 candidate/finding tool calls, and submitted three formal
findings. Peak estimated context was 11,876 tokens, the largest individual
input was 17,190 tokens, and four per-trajectory automatic context compactions
occurred. All 24 target files are byte-identical in the independent control
snapshot.

Offline adjudication dynamically confirmed two memory-safety roots. First,
`tools/yuvcmp.c` sizes its macroblock-error bitmap using floor-rounded
`width / 16` and `height / 16`, while its luma and chroma comparison loops map
every active sample, including partial macroblocks, into that bitmap. Two valid
17x16 YUV420P inputs differing only at luma pixel `(16,0)` select index one in
a one-byte allocation. ASan reports the one-byte heap-buffer-overflow
read-modify-write on both sealed snapshots. The separate hunter claim about
`dump_blocks` is rejected: that loop enumerates only the allocated
`mb_x * mb_y` complete blocks, so it never independently reaches a partial
right or bottom block. Durable artifacts are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_yuvcmp_partial_mb_reproducer.c`,
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_yuvcmp_partial_mb_reproducer.py`, and the matching
structured records under the reproducer results directory.

Second, the DVD subtitle encoder checks a one-nibble-per-pixel RLE budget as
`floor(width * height / 2)`. It encodes the even and odd fields separately,
however, and pads every odd-width row to a complete byte. Its actual minimum
for this case is `ceil(width / 2) * height`. A public 1x200 bitmap subtitle and
a 142-byte output buffer pass the 100-byte RLE check but require 200 bytes;
ASan reports a stack-buffer-overflow in `dvd_encode_rle` on both snapshots.
The durable artifacts are `evaluations/ffmpeg_dvdsub_odd_width_reproducer.c`,
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_dvdsub_odd_width_reproducer.py`, and their matching
structured records.

The rav1e finding is retained with a narrower, source-accurate classification.
A disposable pass-one-only change was required to make this FFmpeg snapshot
emit real legacy stats with rav1e 0.7.1; the resulting complete stream was 156
bytes: a 68-byte summary followed by 88 bytes of frame packets. The exact
unmodified FFmpeg wrapper consumed that stream successfully in pass two.
After partial consumption, `set_stats` advances `pass_data + pass_pos` but
continues passing the original total `pass_size`. Rav1e immediately creates a
Rust slice from that pointer and length, so the declared range exceeds the
FFmpeg allocation and violates the FFI precondition. Current rav1e consumed
only the next required eight bytes and Valgrind observed no physical
out-of-allocation access. The survivor is therefore recorded as real
source-and-API-confirmed FFI undefined behavior, not as an observed heap read.
The hunter's separate pass-one EOS `memcpy` overflow is rejected: rav1e's final
summary is designed to overwrite its placeholder header, the observed summary
was 68 bytes, and the existing fast-realloc capacity was 125 bytes, so the
tested write fit. No contract proving a larger summary was established.

The remaining terminal leads resolved to producer or allocation contracts.
AVRn's interlaced last-row copy extends four bytes beyond the logical packet
length but remains inside FFmpeg's mandatory input-padding region. XPM
allocates the complete `NB_ELEMENTS`-to-the-power-`cpp` lookup space. Y41P's
packet check rounds width up and its image planes have aligned storage. IL can
leave an odd final row uninitialized but does not leave its allocations. LXF
PCM's five-byte blocks produce the two samples accounted for by the frame
size. Movtext bounds text, boxes, styles, and font-table traversal by packet
remaining sizes, while APNG checks both chunk and accumulated extradata
arithmetic against `INT_MAX`.

QTRLE's two-times-base-material packet allocation covers the raw-pixel and
per-code worst case plus its explicit line and frame overhead. CBS H.264/5
grows its destination on `ENOSPC`, and its source bit offset and size originate
inside the parsed unit. ALAC's 4,096-sample work buffers match the generic
encoder frame cap. VVC slice counts and cumulative explicit-slice counts are
parser-capped below `VVC_MAX_SLICES`. MIPS VP9 and LoongArch VP8 vector reads
operate under their reference-frame edge-padding contracts. DNN UV scaling
uses input/output chroma geometry matched to allocated frames; swscale's
converter byte counts are paired with the caller-derived destination strides;
and the reviewed top-level FFmpeg, WMV2, color-temperature, concat, ID3, and
public API header paths established no additional violated memory or lifetime
invariant.

The deterministic all-results selector audit now finds exactly 780 unique
bounded paths across 75 event ledgers, none outside the 4,995-file corpus.
Withholding ranks 757–780 reproduces their sealed manifest and hash exactly.
Current totals are 38 confirmed root causes and 33 dynamically reproduced
issues; the five source/API-confirmed cases are H.264, Vulkan HEVC, TensorFlow's
tensor leak, Whisper, and rav1e. Coverage is 780/4,995 (15.62%), with 4,215
ranked files remaining. The next unchanged exact-path manifest seals ranks
781–804 with SHA-256
`5961e2cbbe97fb77e5b01f4bbf38058c8f383ef34a057b6960162f07620f4d8a`.

### Blind wave 781–804, scaffold recovery, and sealed-survivor scoring

The first replacement-endpoint pass dispatched all 24 exact paths and used
7,355,660 tokens, but it is invalid as a negative result. The old source-action
accounting recognized only nine direct source-tool users, and the proof
scaffold could deadlock when its first state-interaction anchor did not yield a
complete domain. It continued demanding a distinguished token, producer, and
transfer that did not exist instead of allowing another anchor or ordinary
candidate-ledger analysis. The run made 138 candidate/finding calls but
submitted no findings.

The scaffold now accepts a state domain only when all three required roles are
present, retries as many as three ranked source windows, and then explicitly
falls back to the generic candidate-ledger workflow. Ranked-window retries are
allowed through the state and proof gates. Campaign accounting also treats a
successful `read_ranked_window` as a source-bearing action while continuing to
reject failed reads.

The corrected sealed rerun completed all 24 trajectories with source-bearing
actions under the corrected accounting. It used 8,383,144 tokens over 878 model
calls, made 213 candidate/finding calls, and performed 30 automatic context
compactions. It submitted no formal findings.

Only after the run closed was it scored against the two hidden survivors in
this wave. The D3D12VA H.264 trajectory independently reconstructed the real
upload-resource overflow: the fixed mapped resource is sized from decoded
image geometry while attacker-controlled slice bytes plus inserted start codes
are copied without a capacity check. It remained an investigating terminal
candidate rather than a formal submission. The `vf_mestimate` trajectory
instead followed side-data and predictor-array hypotheses and missed the
public `INT_MAX` option reaching signed `1 << 31`. Effective hidden-survivor
recall is therefore 1/2 from terminal ledgers and 0/2 from formal findings.
Offline review of the other terminal candidates established no additional
violated memory or lifetime invariant.

These two previously sealed cases bring the corpus totals to 40 confirmed root
causes and 34 dynamically reproduced issues. The D3D12VA case remains
source-and-producer-confirmed because no Windows D3D12 runtime was available;
the `mestimate` case is UBSan-reproduced on both sealed snapshots. For
longitudinal consistency, coverage remains reported against the historical
4,995-file corpus: 804/4,995 (16.10%), with 4,191 ranked files remaining. This
machine's configuration enumerates 4,993 files rather than the historical
4,995, but the deterministic path order for ranks 781–828 is unchanged; the
denominator difference does not alter either sealed wave.

The next unchanged exact-path manifest seals ranks 805–828 in
`evaluations/sourcehunt_ffmpeg_next_unseen_paths_0805_0828.json` with SHA-256
`5eb4481610d4a6b57bf30b3a5fa76f215fc654e5e5f77e76a5ed49d2803004c5`.

### Blind wave 805–828, native source-action recovery, and HEVC rediscovery

The first sealed pass hunted all 24 exact paths but is invalid as a negative
result because only 14 trajectories completed a source-bearing action. The
replacement endpoint emitted textual imitations of tool calls for the other
ten. That pass used 4,233,005 tokens over 457 model calls, made 93
candidate/finding calls, and submitted no formal findings. A first pinned
replay recovered `vf_estdif.c`, using 392,627 tokens and six candidate calls,
but the remaining nine paths still emitted text. A bounded prompt-only retry
then stopped those nine honestly as `no_source_action`, using 84,202 tokens and
making no candidate calls; it did not improve native-tool coverage.

The client now carries OpenAI-compatible required tool selection through
`extra_body` while preserving the DeepSeek thinking-off passthrough. For the
window scaffold, the hunter structurally requires `rank_source_windows` and
then `read_ranked_window` by name until one source read succeeds. Failed source
tools returned as either structured errors or `ERROR:` strings do not satisfy
coverage. A live generic and named-tool probe confirmed that the replacement
endpoint honors both request shapes. The proof-refinement profile retains one
bounded text-only retry as a fail-closed fallback.

The first structural replay recovered five more paths. It used 1,991,453
tokens and made 48 candidate calls; three concurrent hunters failed on
endpoint HTTP 500 responses and `vcr1.c` selected an invalid initial path. A
final four-path replay used named tool selection at concurrency one and
recovered all four remaining paths, using 1,277,622 tokens and 30 candidate
calls. The accepted primary and recovery artifacts therefore close source
coverage at 24/24 with 7,894,707 tokens over 872 model calls, 177
candidate/finding calls, 24 context compactions, and no formal findings.

Offline review promoted no new root cause. The strongest terminal ledger did
independently reconstruct the already-confirmed D3D12VA upload overflow in the
HEVC backend: the resource is sized from decoded-image geometry while every
accepted slice byte plus an inserted start code is copied without a capacity
check. The other terminal candidates resolved to concrete contracts. FITS can
store `NAXIS1` through `NAXIS999`, but its eight-byte keyword field cannot
represent `NAXIS1000` and the exact sequence check rejects the truncated key
before indexing past `naxisn[998]`. MLV's packet API allocates the requested
read size and handles short input, XBM's worst-case row and header bytes fit
its formula, and MicroDVD's style parser only accumulates a bounded bitmask.
H.264 prediction modes remain below the lookup-table bounds, FFV1 slice-count
products are explicitly capped, and codec-parameter extradata addition is
guarded below `INT32_MAX`.

The reviewed filter leads likewise stayed inside their allocations: ANLMDN's
`K`, `S`, `H`, and `N` relations cover every SSD neighbor; SITI performs no
gradient writes for sub-three-pixel dimensions; reverse grows each array
before indexing; ESTDIF clamps interpolation coordinates; and W3FDIF,
grayworld, select, colorspace, and swscale inherit negotiated plane geometry
and stride contracts. CNG's reflection coefficients can destabilize numeric
output but not the fixed synthesis buffers. The VCR1 side-data, FFV1 Vulkan,
movenc CENC, Argo ASF, and EATGQ candidates similarly lacked a producer that
violated the relevant allocation, packet-padding, or framework invariant.

Only after that adjudication was complete was the wave scored against its one
sealed survivor. The HEVC trajectory is a terminal-ledger hit on the existing
D3D12VA H.264/HEVC root, so effective recall is 1/1 from terminal ledgers and
0/1 from formal findings. Because this is the other duplicated backend for a
root already counted after ranks 781–804, totals remain 40 confirmed root
causes and 34 dynamically reproduced issues. Coverage is 828/4,995 (16.58%),
with 4,167 historically ranked files remaining. This machine enumerates 4,993
files, but directly slicing its deterministic order reproduces ranks 805–828
exactly.

The next unchanged exact-path manifest seals ranks 829–852 in
`evaluations/sourcehunt_ffmpeg_next_unseen_paths_0829_0852.json` with SHA-256
`03fd69edb49c46053faf005d622eedd34036c29fef1d7f79f89f08d130869c82`.

### Blind wave 829–852 and libxevd packet-boundary read

The unchanged treatment completed all 24 exact-path trajectories with a
successful source-bearing action. It used 8,769,899 tokens over 889 model
calls, made 176 candidate/finding calls, performed 23 automatic context
compactions, and submitted one formal finding. Peak estimated context was
11,987 tokens and the largest individual input was 17,272 tokens.

The formal libxevd finding survives with a corrected sink. XEVD NAL length
prefixes are four bytes, not the two bytes stated in the hunter's prose, and
the claimed next-loop read is unreachable because an oversized `bs_read_pos`
makes the loop exit. The root invariant is nevertheless real:
`read_nal_unit_length` accepts `info.nalu_len` without comparing it with the
remaining packet, and the current iteration forwards that unchecked value as
`bitb.ssize` to `xevd_decode`.

An actual public FFmpeg decoder call with the eight packet bytes
`00 00 01 00 3a 00 05 64` declares a 256-byte NAL followed by a four-byte SEI
payload whose own payload size is 100. The packet allocation is exactly those
eight bytes plus FFmpeg's 64-byte padding. ASan reports a heap-buffer-overflow
read immediately beyond the complete 72-byte allocation through
`xevd_bsr_flush`, `xevd_bsr_read`, `xevd_eco_sei`, `xevd_dec_nalu`,
`libxevd_receive_frame`, and `avcodec_send_packet`. The pinned XEVD revision is
`0f066b3ea33834fe4e25b41c32c66f912f0b5d30`; the FFmpeg revision is
`795bccdaf57772b1803914dee2f32d52776518e2`. Durable artifacts are
`evaluations/ffmpeg_xevd_length_reproducer.c` and
`evaluations/run_ffmpeg_xevd_length_reproducer.py`.

The remaining terminal leads resolve to concrete contracts. High-bit-depth
H.264 doubles coefficient storage with the pixel width; HEVC transform blocks
are capped at 64; QSV's bounded writer stops advancing; FFV1 allocates every
65,536-entry encoder map; and CBS rejects bit reads beyond the unit. DXV checks
that both words of every eight-byte combination key remain, MMS advances its
pointer only while decrementing the same remaining length, and ordinary MP3
file offsets cannot approach signed overflow. Fax reference runs terminate at
the validated line width, while dictionary ownership flags require
`av_malloc`-compatible adopted values.

VAAPI tone-map metadata remains in the live filter context and procamp's enum
values match its four-entry capability array. YADIF uses one negotiated frame
geometry and per-plane allocation, AFIR returns before a nonpositive tail
copy, Media Foundation callers only read the returned diagnostic string,
MSRLE breaks before the allowed one-past pixel, and VVC validates the slice,
picture header, PPS, SPS, and their IDs before use. The reviewed D3D12 H.264
encoder, GIF decoder, and HDR encoder paths add no independent violated
memory or lifetime invariant.

Only after that adjudication closed was the wave compared with the sealed
survivor set. No sealed survivor falls in ranks 829–852, so libxevd is a novel
root rather than a rediscovery. The formal-finding novelty result is 1/1, with
the exact sink repaired offline. Current totals are 41 confirmed root causes
and 35 dynamically reproduced issues. Coverage is 852/4,995 (17.06%), with
4,143 historically ranked files remaining.

Directly slicing this machine's unchanged 4,993-file deterministic order
reproduces ranks 829–852 and their committed manifest exactly. The next
unchanged exact-path manifest seals ranks 853–876 in
`evaluations/sourcehunt_ffmpeg_next_unseen_paths_0853_0876.json` with SHA-256
`19ad49230ad2664e5f09adf862eb7d5597c2d2c5e48a57801abd49483e31bc9a`.
