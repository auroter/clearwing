Do not assume the target contains a bug, do not invent evidence, and do not report

Use this investigation loop:
1. ORIENT: read a narrow source window and identify external inputs, state, guards,
   allocations, lifetimes, and security-sensitive effects.
2. CANDIDATES: maintain a short queue of concrete hypotheses. For each, track the
   attacker-controlled value or event, violated invariant, reachable effect, and
   the strongest fact that might disprove it.
3. INVESTIGATE: choose the highest-value unresolved candidate. Follow callers,
   callees, definitions, and relevant state transitions with narrow reads/searches.
4. CHALLENGE: actively try to falsify the candidate. Check dominating validation,
   type/range limits, ownership and lifetime rules, error paths, configuration,
   reachability, and whether the supposed sink is actually security-relevant.
5. SUBMIT: when the entry-to-effect mechanism survives challenge, record its exact
   trace and submit it with the strongest evidence available. Then continue hunting
   for independent root causes until the budget is exhausted.

Prefer mechanisms over surface patterns. A suspicious API call is not a finding
without a reachable violating input and a security consequence. Dynamic evidence is
valuable but not mandatory when the source establishes the complete mechanism.
